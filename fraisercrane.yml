- - Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. Not a morning person, are we? Well, never you mind. I am. Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock. I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional. Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force. I can understand why you'd want him to live here, although not many sons would do that, not without getting paid for it. Anyway, coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop. They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they?
  - <i>still groggy</i> And you are...? 
- - Daphne. Daphne Moon. I moved in yesterday. You hired me to take care of your father.
  - <i>realizing</i> Of course. Forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered. 
- - Oh, yes. I completely understand about one's morning ablutions. I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth... 
  - <i>interrupting</i> Miss Moon! For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis? Thank you. <i>goes into kitchen</i> Now, my coffee. 
- - <i>doing a fry-up<i> The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed. 
  - <i>pouring his coffee</i> Good morning to you too, dad. 
- - Morning was two hours ago. And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now.<i>Frasier adjusts his robe, then tastes his coffee. He is not amused.<i>
  - Hey, this isn't my coffee. Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks? 
- - That's it. Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it.
  - <i>pouring it down the sink</i> Didn't that just dress it up? 
- - I like it. Gives it a zing. Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready. <i>He leaves the kitchen with a plate full of fried food.<i>
  - <i>following</i> Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt. 
- - Ah, girlie food. Besides, I already fixed your breakfast. Now, I made you &ldquo;Eggs in a Nest.&rdquo;
  - Ah yes, the Crane family specialty. Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread. I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak. 
- - You want cheese on that?
  - No. I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain. <i>to himself</i> Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast, <i>sees Martin&rsquo;s chair</i> Oh god, it wasn't a dream. I'll get him for this. <i>to Eddie</i> And his little dog, too. <i>opens front door</i> Where's my paper? Who's stolen my paper? Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you! 
- - Yoo-hoo? It's right here, we brought it in for you.
  - <i>to outside world</i> Sorry, sorry. <i>closes door and examines paper</i> Oh, wait a minute, this... where's the rubber band? This paper has been read. 
- - Well don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it.
  - That is not the point. Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you? 
- - You're going to give a speech, aren't you?
  - Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic. 
- - Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on.
  - Let us get something clear. I am not a morning person. I have to ease into my day slowly. First I have my coffee - sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage. Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast. Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper. If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function. My radio show suffers, and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advise, to help them through their troubled lives. I'm sorry if this may sound priggish, but I have grown comfortable with this part of myself. It is the magic that is me. 
- - I know this is a stressful time, and this is new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly. <i>looks down at Frasier's robe<i> Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see.<i>Frasier closes his robe. He sits at the table and starts readingthe paper. Eddie comes over and jumps onto a chair to stare at him.<i>
  - Down Eddie, down. <i>Eddie doesn't move</i> I said down. Good boy Eddie, just get down. Good good, Eddie get down. Eddie, GET DOWN! <i>Eddie still just sits there, staring at Frasier</i> Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me. 
- - Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning. Just ignore him.
  - I'm trying to. 
- - I was talking to the dog.<i>Frasier goes back to his paper, holding it up to block Eddie's view. He slowly lifts it far enough to see Eddie still staring at him. He gives up and walks towards his private bathroom. Eddie follows.<i>
  - Don't even think about it! <i>he leaves, Eddie follows</i><i>FADE OUTScene B KACLFrasier is doing his show.</i>
- - Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two.
  - Hello Leonard, I'm listening.
- - <i>v.o.<i> Oh, hi Dr. Crane. Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah... well, here goes. Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces. Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat, I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home.
  - Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion?
- - Nothing. Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all. I haven't seen another person in eight months.
  - Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia. But you're not alone.
- - But I am alone, Dr. Crane.
  - Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining, so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist. Well, that's all the time we have for today. You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Stay tuned for the news. Then next up, Bob &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show. I never miss it. <i>off air</i> Yeah, right. 
- - Hiya, doc. How're they hangin'?
  - Bulldog, what are you doing here?
- - You want your messages?
  - Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while. Today more than most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude. I've got a fascinating book here, a comfortable chair and a soundproof booth. <i>Just as Frasier leans back and opens his book the door opensand Bulldog walks in pushing his props trolley.</i>
- - Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape! THIS STINKS! THIS IS TOTAL B.S.! THIS... oh, here it is.
  - <i>preparing to leave</i> Let me just get out of your way.
- - Oh, by the way doc, doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents? You know what I would have told him? Sports. You go out there, break some heads- <i>hits himself on the head to illustrate<i> That'll turn him around.
  - Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet. <i>goes into Roz's booth</i>
- - <i>to Frasier, as he starts to exit into the corridor<i> Hold on a second, I have to ask you something. <i>into phone<i> Gary? I broke up with him three weeks ago. The sex was okay, but he was kinda limited. <i>Frasier moves to leave, Roz stops him<i> No, no. <i>into phone<i> It wasn't that Gary was bad in bed. I mean, he knew where all the parts were. Unfortunately, most of them were his. Yes, totally passionless, it was like he was thinking of someone else. I know I was. Somebody's here, I gotta go. Alright? Talk to you later. Bye, mom. <i>hangs up<i>
  - That was your mother? 
- - Yeah, why?
  - You talk to your mother like that? 
- - Well, we're both adults. We talk about everything.
  - Well, isn't that healthy. 
- - What, you don't talk to your dad like that?
  - Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all. 
- - Really?
  - Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really similar people. In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother. You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep.
- - <i>into mike<i> Yes, he called, he'll be right here. <i>to Frasier<i> So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks?
  - Maybe some other time. Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude. I'll go somewhere where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me. I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park. <i>exits</i><i>FADE TO </i>
- - <i>to Martin<i>...so the elephant says, &ldquo;He's with me.&rdquo; <i>they both laugh<i> Oh, Dr. Crane, you're home. We just got back from your father's physical therapy.
  - Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day. Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you, it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting chapter. 
- - Ooh, I understand. So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea?
  - No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you. 
- - <i>sitting in the Chair<i> Whatcha reading?
  - Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting. 
- - I might. Any good?
  - Well, I haven't formed a opinion yet. Oddly enough, I'm having a little trouble getting into it. 
- - <i>after a moment's silence, indicates book<i> Thick.
  - Dad will you... Listen, I don't want to offend, but if you wouldn't mind, could you just leave me alone, let me read my book? 
- - No problem.<i>Martin sits quietly, not looking as Frasier reads. This finallyirks Frasier.<i>
  - What are you doing? 
- - I'm leaving you alone.
  - Well, it's very annoying! 
- - Ah, what's your problem? You've been sucking a lemon all week.
  - All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is, I can't get a moment&rsquo;s peace alone in my own house. 
- - Well, forgive me. When you invited me to move in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room <i>starts to leave<i>
  - <i>quietly</i> Perhaps only evenings. 
- - I heard that!
  - Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot! 
- - Ah, you know, you've always been like this. You were always a fussy little kid, and it's gotten worse ever since. You and your precious morning routine. You gotta have your coffee, you gotta have your quiet, you gotta have this, you gotta have that. Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid.
  - Hey, hey-hey-hey! I don't have to sit here and listen to that! 
- - Ah, if you want everything so perfect, why don't you go live in a bubble?
  - Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting! <i>He storms out the front door and slams it behind him.</i> 
- - That's a nice way to greet your brother. <i>to waiter<i> Caf&eacute; latte, <em>per piachere.<em>
  - I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I've been trying to read this book and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted. 
- - Hello there, Frasier.
  - Oh, what fresh hell is this? 
- - Oh, &ldquo;The Holotropic Mind&rdquo; by Stanislav Grolf. I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness.
  - Great. <i>slams book shut</i> Now you've ruined the ending! 
- - I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate. <i>the waiter brings his coffee<i> <em>Mille Grazie.<em> <i>to Frasier<i> So, how's father?
  - Father? You mean the man who's driving me crazy? The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep? The man who just drove me out of my own home? 
- - And how's work?
  - Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dad and I had another fight. I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is. 
- - Well, what are the alternatives?
  - Well, if I didn't feel so guilty I'd, I'd do what I should have done in the first place just move dad and Daphne into their own apartment. 
- - Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier. It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance. And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place.
  - Refresh me. 
- - You wanted to get closer to dad.
  - I still do. There isn't anything I'd like more, but he makes it impossible. I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee, I can't have any peace in my own home. 
- - So what you&rsquo;re saying is, you want to be closer to dad, but you don't actually want him around. Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him - I mean, really talk to him?
  - Well, I... <i>he thinks about it</i> Maybe I haven't done my best. I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I? Well ah, thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother, and a credit to the psychiatric profession. 
- - <i>entering from back, carrying a box<i> We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement. There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in. We discussed it last night, remember?
  - Of course, of course. 
- - I was just on my way to ask that peculiar little man from building services to give me a hand moving them.
  - Oh yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards. 
- - Remind me again - which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?
  - The brown one.<i>Daphne exits via the front door. Martin enters from the bedroom.</i> 
- - Ah, forget about it. I already have.
  - You know, I guess there's no secret that there's been a lot of tension between us, and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk. And I... I thought we might have a conversation. 
- - Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry.
  - Well thanks, but I'm not. Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier. 
- - Right now?
  - Yes, I think now would be a good time. 
- - Later would be better.
  - It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation, I'm talking about three minutes of your life. 
- - Well, I hope it is only three minutes, 'cause my program's coming on.
  - Well, alright. If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes. <i>He does so, and they sit at the table.</i> 
- - So what do you want to talk about?
  - Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation like two normal people without getting on each other&rsquo;s nerves. Ready? <i>sets timer</i> Go. 
- - This is stupid.
  - <i>stops timer</i> One second? That's our personal best? Let us see if we can beat it. <i>sets timer</i> Ready? Go. 
- - So how about those Seahawks?
  - <i>stops timer</i> No sports. 
- - All right. But no opera.
  - Agreed. <i>sets timer</i> Ready? Go. 
- - <i>pause<i> This is your idea, you say something first.
  - Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself that ah, that you don't know. Ah, six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks, ah, there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. I... And then I thought of Frederick. 
- - And you didn't jump, huh?
  - Good, dad. 
- - Wow. I never knew that.
  - Well, that's the point of this whole experiment. To tell one another something that we don't know about each other. Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn. 
- - Okay. <i>thinks<i> Well, about two months ago, I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me... and all of a sudden something flew up in my eye. And, when I was trying to get it out, I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp.
  - That's it? You call that vulnerable? 
- - Other than this one?
  - Oh, God! Always the flip answer. 
- - It hurt.
  - Oh well... I'm not talking about that kind of pain, I'm talking about your emotions, your soul. Some sort of painful, gut- wrenching experience. 
- - Well, this whole thing's stupid.
  - Well, not to me. Oh, how should I expect anything out of you? You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant, stubborn, cold man I've ever known! 
- - You said &ldquo;egghead&rdquo; twice, too.
  - Oh, you are so infuriating! 
- - You said &ldquo;cold&rdquo; twice, Mr. Egghead.
  - Egghead? Egghead? 
- - Well, you're no day at the beach either. You know what you are? <i>the timer bings<i> I'll tell you later, it's time for my program. <i>moves towards Chair<i>
  - Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is. 
- - Oh, will you give it a rest? 
  - We're not getting along, and it's not getting any better. I'm not sure how to say this, but ah... I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... 
- - I know what you're trying to say. &ldquo;You want what's best for both of us.&rdquo; You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space, and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering.
  - Well, yes. I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all. 
- - Except for one thing. I'm not going.
  - What? 
- - Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship, to make some connection. Well, that kind of thing takes a couple of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it? You're the shrink.
  - Couple of years, huh? 
- - Ah, it'll go by before you know it.
  - Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. 
- - I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.
  - Okay. 
- - Great. How about you and me having a beer together?
  - Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that. I'd love to have a beer with you, dad. 
- - Well then, you better haul ass, 'cause the store closes in ten minutes.
  - Right. <i>exits</i><i>End of Act Two.</i>
- - I don't know. Eddie - must ya? <i>Eddie carries on staring<i> Apparently he must.
  - <i>to Eddie</i> What is so fascinating about me? What is it? Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some sort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me.<i>Daphne enters carrying a tray of food.</i> 
- - Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the "Weeping Lotus" murder. 
  - Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years. 
- - Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt certain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells me that this case can be cracked. There just must be one small thing I keep overlooking. <i>tidies papers<i>
  - There is - who the murderer was. <i>laughs</i><i>The doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and Martin chat.</i> 
- - It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to stuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing!<i>At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a bottle of wine. He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.<i>
  - Hello, Niles. 
- - Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it shattered her calm.
  - Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high strung? Maybe she should see someone. 
- - No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this "Doctor" and "Mrs. Crane" formality. To you, it's Niles and... <i>stumped<i> er...
  - Maris. 
- - I'm famished.
  - Me, too.<i>Niles and Frasier begin to eat...</i> 
- - We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have blessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together and we also thank you for the other gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able to share with those less fortunate...
  - <i>to Eddie</i> OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING! 
- - So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? You were mentioned.
  - No, I missed it. 
- - Just as well, it wasn't flattering. 
  - I still would have liked to have seen it anyway. 
- - He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the <i>Times<i>. The things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny - what did he say about you?
  - <i>reading</i> "I hate Frasier Crane." 
- - <i>laughs, then<i> Oh, sorry. 
  - That's it. "I hate Frasier Crane." That's it? 
- - Oh, don't let it bother you.
  - Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, it's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in yellow! Now, who would like some wine? 
- - Daphne, this salad is exquisite.
  - <i>sitting down</i> Now why would he say that? 
- - Must be the carrots, he always did like them.
  - Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing like that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is totally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake. 
- - Oh, for crying out loud!
  - Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the trash.<i>Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.</i> 
- - <i>v.o<i> Okay. 
  - All right, good girl. Now your problem...
- - <i>beep<i> Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is trying to get through. Do you mind if I take it? 
  - No, no. Go right ahead. <i>she does</i> Well, certainly a very interesting situation she's got herself into. Don't you think so, Roz?<i>Roz is busy eating and reading magazines. She has to quickly chew her food, put down her books just for the simple</i> 
- - Okay, I'm back. 
  - All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems...
- - <i>beep<i> Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. 
  - For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is popular. <i>laughs</i>
- - Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. <i>beep<i> Oh, I don't believe it - another call. 
  - Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take that other call is the same reason that you want to change your career and break up with your boyfriend. You're obsessed with what you think you're missing. The better offer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on. Fully explore and experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger person for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?
- - Okay, I'm back! 
  - Thank you for your call. <i>hangs up</i> Well, we've only got two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on a personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column. He said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... "I Hate Frasier Crane". <i>sarcastic</i> What trenchant criticism. Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef t'ouerve "I Hate Frasier Crane." A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not our Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. <i>signs off</i><i>Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then "holsters" itin his belt.FADE TO </i>
- - Frasier, how funny running into you here.
  - I'm always here. 
- - Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago have you seen today's "Times"?
  - <i>knowing what's coming</i> No. 
- - Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek Mann's column.
  - You know, this is the second time in as many days that you have given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting yourself a route? 
- - Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. <i>then, to Frasier<i> Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.
  - So I see. <i>reading</i> "Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism of his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes." 
- - Oh, now I remember you!
  - <i>reading</i> "It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show &mdash; his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice a mock- sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult." 
- - It's continued on twelve.
  - I've read enough! 
- - <i>asking<i> Can I get you something?
  - <i>to Niles</i> How can the man think something like that? 
- - It's my job, I'm a waiter.
  - We don't want anything, thank you. 
- - Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll blow over.
  - Oh, perhaps you're right. As angry as it makes me, to retaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best response is no response at all.<i>FADE TO Scene Four - Radio Station.Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone about the recent newspaper report.</i>
- - Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a problem with delayed gratification.
  - Well, he's just going to have to wait! I don't know who this Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for what he is not a man at all, but half a man! <i>to Roz</i> Now what line did you say Stewart was on? 
- - He hung up.
  - Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. Let's see who's on line five. <i>he presses button</i> Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening.

- - Derek Mann.
  - <i>regretting</i> I see. 
- - Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League twit. So what do you say we settle this like men?
  - Are you implying that you want to fight me? 
- - I'm not implying, I'm saying.
  - Fight, as in a fist fight? 
- - <i>sarcastic<i> No, I thought we might throw pies at each other! So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?

- - Just like I figured, you're chicken.
  - No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject? Who do we have on the line? 
- - <i>v.o<i> So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to fight me or not?
  - Oh, you can't be serious.

- - You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!
  - I am not chicken!

  - Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! You just say the time and place! 
- - Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!

- - Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged you and you're backing down?
  - Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to settle their differences. 
- - A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the way I brought you up.
  - Are you encouraging me to fight? 
- - You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.
  - Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even had lunch yet. 
- - I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel all over again.
  - What did you say? 
- - Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.
  - I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty years ago. 
- - Who's this Billy Kreizel?
  - Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me! 
- - So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.
  - Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my blazer! 
- - Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight after school. Only "Patches" here didn't show up!
  - I had a clarinet lesson! 
- - <i>wondering<i> Couldn't you and Billy have met after the clarinet lesson?
  - Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment! 
- - It's exactly the same.
  - I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a certain position in this city - I do not settle my differences with brawling. 
- - <i>gets up<i> I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a lot in this house. <i>She exits to the kitchen.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation is not the same now. 
- - The man challenged you and you accepted. 
  - Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye. 
- - I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and get your clock cleaned.
  - Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win this fight? 
- - So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say, "Did you get a good look?" And he says, "Not completely, turn around." Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.
  - Roz, why are you telling me this story? 
- - <i>enters<i> Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with balloons...
  - All that's missing is a mariachi band. 
- - Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you doing this?
  - It's Billy Kreizel. 
- - <i>looking around<i> Where?
  - <i>shakes head</i> He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten. 
- - I remember.
  - You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is where it stops. I'm not running anymore. 
- - What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?<i>As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket and buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to Frasier which he refuses.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Chalk it up to random violence!<i>Niles nods in agreement and exits the caf&eacute;. Martin enters.</i> 
- - Hey, there.
  - Dad? What are you doing here? 
- - Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe went over the line.
  - Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do &mdash; well, you're wrong. You can relax. I took this on for myself. 
- - Good.
  - Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway? 
- - Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. <i>points out of window<i> There, the man standing to the left of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, that's Derek Mann.
  - He's gigantic! 
- - Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting a freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. 
  - Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome? 
- - Are you sure you want to go through with this?
  - Yes, yes I am.<i>Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.</i> 
- - <i>begins to leave<i> Well, if we want an unobstructed view...
  - <i>stops him</i> Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You'll only make me nervous. 
- - They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.<i>Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. The officer marches Frasier right into the Caf&eacute;.<i>
  - Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my jacket.
- - Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in this town we don't settle our differences with street fights - no matter who you are. 
  - Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.
- - Okay. <i>exits<i>
  - Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... God, I feel great! 
- - You did good.
  - Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that... 
- - Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. Not a morning person, are we? Well, never you mind. I am. Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock. I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional. Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force. I can understand why you'd want him to live here, although not many sons would do that, not without getting paid for it. Anyway, coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop. They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they?
  - <i>still groggy</i> And you are...? 
- - Daphne. Daphne Moon. I moved in yesterday. You hired me to take care of your father.
  - <i>realizing</i> Of course. Forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered. 
- - Oh, yes. I completely understand about one's morning ablutions. I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth... 
  - <i>interrupting</i> Miss Moon! For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis? Thank you. <i>goes into kitchen</i> Now, my coffee. 
- - <i>doing a fry-up<i> The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed. 
  - <i>pouring his coffee</i> Good morning to you too, dad. 
- - Morning was two hours ago. And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now.<i>Frasier adjusts his robe, then tastes his coffee. He is not amused.<i>
  - Hey, this isn't my coffee. Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks? 
- - That's it. Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it.
  - <i>pouring it down the sink</i> Didn't that just dress it up? 
- - I like it. Gives it a zing. Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready. <i>He leaves the kitchen with a plate full of fried food.<i>
  - <i>following</i> Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt. 
- - Ah, girlie food. Besides, I already fixed your breakfast. Now, I made you &ldquo;Eggs in a Nest.&rdquo;
  - Ah yes, the Crane family specialty. Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread. I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak. 
- - You want cheese on that?
  - No. I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain. <i>to himself</i> Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast, <i>sees Martin&rsquo;s chair</i> Oh god, it wasn't a dream. I'll get him for this. <i>to Eddie</i> And his little dog, too. <i>opens front door</i> Where's my paper? Who's stolen my paper? Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you!

  - <i>to outside world</i> Sorry, sorry. <i>closes door and examines paper</i> Oh, wait a minute, this... where's the rubber band? This paper has been read. 
- - Well don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it.
  - That is not the point. Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you? 
- - You're going to give a speech, aren't you?
  - Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic. 
- - Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on.
  - Let us get something clear. I am not a morning person. I have to ease into my day slowly. First I have my coffee - sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage. Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast. Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper. If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function. My radio show suffers, and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advise, to help them through their troubled lives. I'm sorry if this may sound priggish, but I have grown comfortable with this part of myself. It is the magic that is me. 
- - I know this is a stressful time, and this is new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly. <i>looks down at Frasier's robe<i> Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see.<i>Frasier closes his robe. He sits at the table and starts readingthe paper. Eddie comes over and jumps onto a chair to stare at him.<i>
  - Down Eddie, down. <i>Eddie doesn't move</i> I said down. Good boy Eddie, just get down. Good good, Eddie get down. Eddie, GET DOWN! <i>Eddie still just sits there, staring at Frasier</i> Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me. 
- - Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning. Just ignore him.
  - I'm trying to. 
- - I was talking to the dog.<i>Frasier goes back to his paper, holding it up to block Eddie's view. He slowly lifts it far enough to see Eddie still staring at him. He gives up and walks towards his private bathroom. Eddie follows.<i>
  - Don't even think about it! <i>he leaves, Eddie follows</i><i>FADE OUTScene B KACLFrasier is doing his show.</i>
- - Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two.
  - Hello Leonard, I'm listening.
- - <i>v.o.<i> Oh, hi Dr. Crane. Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah... well, here goes. Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces. Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat, I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home.
  - Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion?
- - Nothing. Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all. I haven't seen another person in eight months.
  - Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia. But you're not alone.
- - But I am alone, Dr. Crane.
  - Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining, so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist. Well, that's all the time we have for today. You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Stay tuned for the news. Then next up, Bob &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show. I never miss it. <i>off air</i> Yeah, right. 
- - You want your messages?
  - Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while. Today more than most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude. I've got a fascinating book here, a comfortable chair and a soundproof booth. <i>Just as Frasier leans back and opens his book the door opensand Bulldog walks in pushing his props trolley.</i>
- - Hiya, doc. How're they hangin'?
  - Bulldog, what are you doing here?
- - Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape! THIS STINKS! THIS IS TOTAL B.S.! THIS... oh, here it is.
  - <i>preparing to leave</i> Let me just get out of your way.
- - Oh, by the way doc, doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents? You know what I would have told him? Sports. You go out there, break some heads- <i>hits himself on the head to illustrate<i> That'll turn him around.
  - Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet. <i>goes into Roz's booth</i>

Bye, mom. <i>hangs up<i>
  - That was your mother? 
- - Yeah, why?
  - You talk to your mother like that? 
- - Well, we're both adults. We talk about everything.
  - Well, isn't that healthy. 
- - What, you don't talk to your dad like that?
  - Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all. 
- - Really?
  - Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really similar people. In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother. You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep.
- - <i>into mike<i> Yes, he called, he'll be right here. <i>to Frasier<i> So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks?
  - Maybe some other time. Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude. I'll go somewhere where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me. I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park. <i>exits</i><i>FADE TO </i>

  - Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day. Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you, it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting chapter. 
- - Ooh, I understand. So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea?
  - No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you. 
- - <i>sitting in the Chair<i> Whatcha reading?
  - Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting. 
- - I might. Any good?

  - Dad will you... Listen, I don't want to offend, but if you wouldn't mind, could you just leave me alone, let me read my book? 
- - No problem.<i>Martin sits quietly, not looking as Frasier reads. This finallyirks Frasier.<i>
  - What are you doing? 
- - I'm leaving you alone.
  - Well, it's very annoying! 
- - Ah, what's your problem? You've been sucking a lemon all week.
  - All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is, I can't get a moment&rsquo;s peace alone in my own house. 
- - Well, forgive me. When you invited me to move in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room <i>starts to leave<i>
  - <i>quietly</i> Perhaps only evenings. 
- - I heard that!
  - Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot! 
- - Ah, you know, you've always been like this. You were always a fussy little kid, and it's gotten worse ever since. You and your precious morning routine. You gotta have your coffee, you gotta have your quiet, you gotta have this, you gotta have that. Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid.
  - Hey, hey-hey-hey! I don't have to sit here and listen to that! 
- - Ah, if you want everything so perfect, why don't you go live in a bubble?
  - Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting! <i>He storms out the front door and slams it behind him.</i> 
- - Hello there, Frasier.
  - Oh, what fresh hell is this? 
- - That's a nice way to greet your brother. <i>to waiter<i> Caf&eacute; latte, <em>per piachere.<em>
  - I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I've been trying to read this book and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted. 
- - Oh, &ldquo;The Holotropic Mind&rdquo; by Stanislav Grolf. I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness.
  - Great. <i>slams book shut</i> Now you've ruined the ending! 
- - And how's work?
  - Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dad and I had another fight. I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is. 
- - I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate. <i>the waiter brings his coffee<i> <em>Mille Grazie.<em> <i>to Frasier<i> So, how's father?
  - Father? You mean the man who's driving me crazy? The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep? The man who just drove me out of my own home? 
- - Well, what are the alternatives?
  - Well, if I didn't feel so guilty I'd, I'd do what I should have done in the first place just move dad and Daphne into their own apartment. 
- - Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier. It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance. And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place.
  - Refresh me. 
- - You wanted to get closer to dad.
  - I still do. There isn't anything I'd like more, but he makes it impossible. I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee, I can't have any peace in my own home. 
- - So what you&rsquo;re saying is, you want to be closer to dad, but you don't actually want him around. Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him - I mean, really talk to him?
  - Well, I... <i>he thinks about it</i> Maybe I haven't done my best. I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I? Well ah, thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother, and a credit to the psychiatric profession. 
- - <i>entering from back, carrying a box<i> We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement. There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in. We discussed it last night, remember?
  - Of course, of course.

  - Oh yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards. 
- - Remind me again - which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?
  - The brown one.<i>Daphne exits via the front door. Martin enters from the bedroom.</i> 
- - Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry.
  - Well thanks, but I'm not. Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier. 
- - Right now?
  - Yes, I think now would be a good time. 
- - Later would be better.
  - It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation, I'm talking about three minutes of your life. 
- - Ah, forget about it. I already have.
  - You know, I guess there's no secret that there's been a lot of tension between us, and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk. And I... I thought we might have a conversation. 
- - So what do you want to talk about?
  - Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation like two normal people without getting on each other&rsquo;s nerves. Ready? <i>sets timer</i> Go. 
- - Well, I hope it is only three minutes, 'cause my program's coming on.
  - Well, alright. If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes. <i>He does so, and they sit at the table.</i> 
- - This is stupid.

  - Agreed. <i>sets timer</i> Ready? Go.

  - Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself that ah, that you don't know. Ah, six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks, ah, there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. I... And then I thought of Frederick. 
- - And you didn't jump, huh?
  - Good, dad. 
- - Wow. I never knew that.
  - Well, that's the point of this whole experiment. To tell one another something that we don't know about each other. Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn. 
- - Okay. <i>thinks<i> Well, about two months ago, I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me... and all of a sudden something flew up in my eye. And, when I was trying to get it out, I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp.
  - That's it? You call that vulnerable? 
- - It hurt.
  - Oh well... I'm not talking about that kind of pain, I'm talking about your emotions, your soul. Some sort of painful, gut- wrenching experience. 
- - Other than this one?
  - Oh, God! Always the flip answer. 
- - Well, this whole thing's stupid.
  - Well, not to me. Oh, how should I expect anything out of you? You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant, stubborn, cold man I've ever known! 
- - You said &ldquo;cold&rdquo; twice, Mr. Egghead.
  - Egghead? Egghead? 
- - You said &ldquo;egghead&rdquo; twice, too.
  - Oh, you are so infuriating! 
- - Well, you're no day at the beach either. You know what you are? <i>the timer bings<i> I'll tell you later, it's time for my program. <i>moves towards Chair<i>
  - Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is. 
- - Oh, will you give it a rest? 
  - We're not getting along, and it's not getting any better. I'm not sure how to say this, but ah... I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... 
- - I know what you're trying to say. &ldquo;You want what's best for both of us.&rdquo; You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space, and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering.
  - Well, yes. I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all. 
- - Except for one thing. I'm not going.
  - What? 
- - Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship, to make some connection. Well, that kind of thing takes a couple of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it? You're the shrink.
  - Couple of years, huh? 
- - Ah, it'll go by before you know it.
  - Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. 
- - I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.
  - Okay. 
- - Great. How about you and me having a beer together?
  - Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that. I'd love to have a beer with you, dad. 
- - Well then, you better haul ass, 'cause the store closes in ten minutes.
  - Right. <i>exits</i><i>End of Act Two.</i>

  - <i>to Eddie</i> What is so fascinating about me? What is it? Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some sort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me.<i>Daphne enters carrying a tray of food.</i> 
- - Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the "Weeping Lotus" murder. 
  - Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years. 
- - Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt certain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells me that this case can be cracked. There just must be one small thing I keep overlooking. <i>tidies papers<i>
  - There is - who the murderer was. <i>laughs</i><i>The doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and Martin chat.</i> 
- - It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to stuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing!<i>At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a bottle of wine. He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.<i>
  - Hello, Niles. 
- - Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it shattered her calm.
  - Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high strung? Maybe she should see someone. 
- - No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this "Doctor" and "Mrs. Crane" formality. To you, it's Niles and... <i>stumped<i> er...
  - Maris. 
- - I'm famished.
  - Me, too.<i>Niles and Frasier begin to eat...</i> 
- - We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have blessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together and we also thank you for the other gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able to share with those less fortunate...
  - <i>to Eddie</i> OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING! 
- - So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? You were mentioned.
  - No, I missed it. 
- - Just as well, it wasn't flattering. 
  - I still would have liked to have seen it anyway. 
- - He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the <i>Times<i>. The things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny - what did he say about you?
  - <i>reading</i> "I hate Frasier Crane." 
- - <i>laughs, then<i> Oh, sorry. 
  - That's it. "I hate Frasier Crane." That's it? 
- - Oh, don't let it bother you.
  - Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, it's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in yellow! Now, who would like some wine? 
- - Daphne, this salad is exquisite.
  - <i>sitting down</i> Now why would he say that? 
- - Oh, for crying out loud!
  - Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the trash.<i>Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.</i> 
- - Must be the carrots, he always did like them.
  - Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing like that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is totally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake. 
- - <i>v.o<i> Okay. 
  - All right, good girl. Now your problem...
- - Okay, I'm back. 
  - All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems...

- - Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. <i>beep<i> Oh, I don't believe it - another call. 
  - Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take that other call is the same reason that you want to change your career and break up with your boyfriend. You're obsessed with what you think you're missing. The better offer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on. Fully explore and experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger person for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?
- - Okay, I'm back! 
  - Thank you for your call. <i>hangs up</i> Well, we've only got two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on a personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column. He said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... "I Hate Frasier Crane". <i>sarcastic</i> What trenchant criticism. Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef t'ouerve "I Hate Frasier Crane." A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not our Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. <i>signs off</i><i>Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then "holsters" itin his belt.FADE TO </i>
- - Frasier, how funny running into you here.
  - I'm always here. 
- - Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago have you seen today's "Times"?
  - <i>knowing what's coming</i> No. 
- - Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek Mann's column.
  - You know, this is the second time in as many days that you have given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting yourself a route? 
- - Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. <i>then, to Frasier<i> Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.
  - So I see. <i>reading</i> "Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism of his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes." 
- - Oh, now I remember you!
  - <i>reading</i> "It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show &mdash; his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice a mock- sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult." 
- - It's continued on twelve.
  - I've read enough! 
- - <i>asking<i> Can I get you something?
  - <i>to Niles</i> How can the man think something like that? 
- - It's my job, I'm a waiter.
  - We don't want anything, thank you. 
- - Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll blow over.
  - Oh, perhaps you're right. As angry as it makes me, to retaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best response is no response at all.<i>FADE TO Scene Four - Radio Station.Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone about the recent newspaper report.</i>
- - Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a problem with delayed gratification.
  - Well, he's just going to have to wait! I don't know who this Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for what he is not a man at all, but half a man! <i>to Roz</i> Now what line did you say Stewart was on? 
- - He hung up.
  - Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. Let's see who's on line five. <i>he presses button</i> Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening. 
- - <i>v.o<i> Good, because I was listening too.
  - And you are? 
- - Derek Mann.
  - <i>regretting</i> I see. 
- - Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League twit. So what do you say we settle this like men?
  - Are you implying that you want to fight me? 
- - I'm not implying, I'm saying.
  - Fight, as in a fist fight? 
- - <i>sarcastic<i> No, I thought we might throw pies at each other! So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?
  - <i>thinks</i> We'll be right back after these messages.<i>Frasier signs off for commercials as we fade out.End Of Act One. (Time 1105)Act Two.Scene One - Radio Station.The scene resumes where we left off. The commercials have finished and Frasier gets back to his radio show.</i>
- - <i>v.o<i> So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to fight me or not?
  - Oh, you can't be serious. 
- - Just like I figured, you're chicken.
  - No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject? Who do we have on the line? 
- - You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!
  - I am not chicken! 
- - <i>squawks like a chicken<i>
  - We are mature thinking people, not cavemen! 
- - <i>squawks some more<i>
  - Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! You just say the time and place! 
- - Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!
  - I won't! Don't you back out either because I know where your office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you down! Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!<i>FADE TO</i>
- - He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the door...<i>At this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing tips and a trench coat - it's Frasier.<i>
  - Hello, everyone. 
- - Sometimes I get my signals crossed.
  - What's going on? 
- - You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him. 
  - <i>worried</i> Yes I did, didn't I? 
- - I can't wait to see that.
  - Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad. 
- - What are you talking about?
  - Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I stand to benefit by going through with actually going through with a fist fight? 
- - Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged you and you're backing down?
  - Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to settle their differences. 
- - A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the way I brought you up.
  - Are you encouraging me to fight? 
- - I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel all over again.
  - What did you say? 
- - You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.
  - Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even had lunch yet. 
- - Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.
  - I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty years ago. 
- - Who's this Billy Kreizel?
  - Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me! 
- - So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.
  - Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my blazer! 
- - Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight after school. Only "Patches" here didn't show up!
  - I had a clarinet lesson! 
- - <i>wondering<i> Couldn't you and Billy have met after the clarinet lesson?
  - Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment! 
- - <i>gets up<i> I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a lot in this house. <i>She exits to the kitchen.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation is not the same now. 
- - It's exactly the same.
  - I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a certain position in this city - I do not settle my differences with brawling. 
- - The man challenged you and you accepted. 
  - Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye. 
- - So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say, "Did you get a good look?" And he says, "Not completely, turn around." Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.
  - Roz, why are you telling me this story? 
- - I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and get your clock cleaned.
  - Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win this fight? 
- - <i>enters<i> Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with balloons...
  - All that's missing is a mariachi band. 
- - Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you doing this?
  - It's Billy Kreizel. 
- - <i>looking around<i> Where?
  - <i>shakes head</i> He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten. 
- - I remember.
  - You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is where it stops. I'm not running anymore. 
- - What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?<i>As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket and buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to Frasier which he refuses.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Chalk it up to random violence!<i>Niles nods in agreement and exits the caf&eacute;. Martin enters.</i> 
- - Hey, there.
  - Dad? What are you doing here? 
- - Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe went over the line.
  - Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do &mdash; well, you're wrong. You can relax. I took this on for myself. 
- - Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting a freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. 
  - Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome? 
- - Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. <i>points out of window<i> There, the man standing to the left of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, that's Derek Mann.
  - He's gigantic! 
- - Good.
  - Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway? 
- - Are you sure you want to go through with this?
  - Yes, yes I am.<i>Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.</i> 
- - <i>begins to leave<i> Well, if we want an unobstructed view...
  - <i>stops him</i> Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You'll only make me nervous. 
- - They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.<i>Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. The officer marches Frasier right into the Caf&eacute;.<i>
  - Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my jacket.
- - Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in this town we don't settle our differences with street fights - no matter who you are. 
  - Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.
- - Okay. <i>exits<i>
  - Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... God, I feel great! 
- - You did good.
  - Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that...
