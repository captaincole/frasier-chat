- - No, it was a B-52.<i>Frasier comes in from the bedroom.<i>
  - Well, Dad's done it again. That was Dr. Jennings's office on the phone. He's skipped his physical again today. 
- - Frasier, you know Dad's intense aversion to doctors, you should have seen that he got there.
  - Yes, well I didn't see you volunteering this afternoon. 
- - Wait 'til your father gets here, I'll give him such a piece of my mind.<i>Eddie comes bounding out of the bedroom, bounces over the furnitureand sits by the door.<i>
  - If only we had some way of knowing if he was about to arrive.<i>Martin enters.</i> 
- - <i>to Eddie<i> Hey, how ya doin', boy? Yeah, glad to see you too.
  - So. How was your exam today? 
- - Oh, you know. Everything's pretty routine.
  - EKG? 
- - Textbook.
  - Hope they took a full blood panel. 
- - Because I feel fine. I'll go to the doctor when I don't feel fine. Besides, I don't like Dr. Jennings. He's got a model of a colon on his desk, he keeps his tongue depressors in it.
  - Well, all right Dad, fine. If you don't like him, why don't you go to see my doctor, she's one of the finest gastroenterologists in this city. 
- - Now now, we'll have none of that. We women have been poked and prodded by male doctors for centuries. I say it's high time you gents went to see a doctor of the opposite sex. See how you like waiting in that room - sitting there all naked and helpless and goose-bumpy. 
  - Niles, surely you could recommend someone? <i>Niles is staring at Daphne, in a warm, happy world of his own.</i>
- - I'm sorry, my mind was somewhere else. Rec... OH! I know who you should see - Dr. Gary Newman. His office is in my building, he has a very successful practice, I saw a Lichtenstein hanging in his office.
  - Ooh, Lichtenstein. He sounds perfect. 
- - Alright, alright. I'll make an appointment, I'll go see him.
  - Oh, now just hang on a second there, mister. I will make the arrangements and I will escort you personally. 
- - Oh, stop grumbling. It won't be so bad. Well, unless you have to parade around the office in one of those gowns where your little bum peeks through the back.
  - So Niles, what's Dr. Newman's number? <i>But Niles is tuned out again.</i>
- - My appointment was supposed to be half an hour ago, how much longer are we gonna wait for this guy? Come on Frasier, let's get out of here.
  - Dad, Dad, just relax. Read a magazine. Oh, here, here. Take the Cosmo quiz. 
- - <i>reading<i> "Are your nipples sensitive?"
  - Would you mind doing that quietly, it's not an oral exam. 
- - Yes, I'm sorry. The doctor's running a little late this morning, but you'll be first up when he gets in. 
  - When he gets in? My God, where's he coming from, Spokane?
- - Actually he has a long drive in from his weekend house at Lake Shalonne. 
  - Lake Shalonne? Ooh, this guy must be terrific! <i>He goes back to Martin.</i> 
- - You haven't seen the second question. Did you used to keep your patients waiting like this?
  - Oh, just the compulsives. It was part of their therapy. Relax there, I'll take care of it. <i>He goes to the receptionist's cubicle.</i> 
- - So?
  - Dad, relax. He'll be here any minute. <i>looking around</i> You know Dad, I was just struck by one of life's little ironies. I remember you taking me to the doctor, and now here I am taking you. 
- - Yeah. I remember when I took you for your first tetanus shot, you were about five or six.
  - Oh boy, was I scared. I remember you holding my hand. 
- - Yeah. Bent over that table, dropped your little drawers. When the nurse gave you the shot, you took your mind off it by reciting the names of all of Puccini's operas. Right then I knew you'd never be a cop. Look, I'm serious. I'm not staying any longer, let's go.
  - All right dad, look, I'll check and see if there's someone substituting for him. 
- - <i>who wishes he hadn't started this<i> I have sensitive nipples.<i>Frasier comes back. He is the bearer of bad news.<i>
  - Dad? I'm afraid the doctor won't be able to make your appointment today. 
- - Oh, that's just great. These big-shot doctors, they keep you waiting for an hour and then they don't even have the decency to show up! What, play a little slow on the golf course today? That arrogant, inconsiderate jerk!
  - Dad, Dad, Dad &mdash; Dr. Newman is dead. He died an hour ago. 
- - Well? These things happen.
  - These things happen? Roz, how can you say that? My God, this was not an old man, he was my age. 
- - What am I supposed to say? I guess I don't think of these things like you do. Guess it's because you're forty-one and I'm... <i>laughs<i> not.
  - Don't you ever think about you're own mortality? Don't you ever think about dying? 
- - Well, not me dying, but you know what I have thought about lately? I've been dating this older guy, and what if... you know? <i>Frasier doesn't<i> We were in bed together and he dropped dead? Well, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Sometimes he starts breathing very funny and I don't know if he's having a good time or if I've overexcited him to some dangerous level.
  - Someone certainly has a very high opinion of herself. 
- - Everybody's good at something.
  - Why is it that every time we try to have a serious discussion, we end up talking about your sex life? 
- - Well, I'll just pop into the kitchen and fix us a snack. <i>She exits.<i>
  - <i>taking a large folder over to the table</i> Pump iron? Niles, you don't even pump your own gas. 
- - All right, all right. Now what is all this nonsense about getting your affairs in order?
  - Well, it's this Dr. Newman dying at such a young age really threw me for a loop. I was trying to figure out why, and I finally realized that I hadn't made the proper provisions for my own death. 
- - Oh! Here, allow me. <i>He takes the jar but has even less success. Frasier distributesfiles to each person.<i>
  - First, the pertinent information. I've prepared copies for each of you. The location and numbers of my bank accounts; <i>Niles is still struggling with the jar</i> my safety deposit keys; the number for my attorney... Niles, what are you doing? Oh, give me that! <i>He takes the jar and opens it.</i> 
- - <i>to Daphne<i> I loosened it for him.
  - Now, the distribution of my personal possessions. 
- - Oh, I really think this is a matter for family only.
  - No, no Daphne, please, I'd like you to stay. I'll come to you later. Dad, Niles, I'd like you to put your names on these stickers, <i>hands them over</i> and place them on any object you'd like bequeathed to you. 
- - This is crazy. I'm not going to start putting my name on your stuff.
  - Dad, what happens if I die tomorrow, you and Niles end up in an argument about... well, that African mask, for instance? 
- - Well, don't look at me. I throw a towel over that thing when you're not home.
  - Okay, fine. Now we come to the issue of... my remains. 
- - Oh, jeez.
  - I've arranged every detail in this easy-to-read binder. <i>gives binder to Martin</i> 
- - Who are you using?
  - Michaelson's. 
- - Excuse me. Excuse me! Are we about done?
  - Well, there is just one more duck to put in the row. I've done some research and I've discovered that most unexpected deaths occur in the home. And Daphne, this is where you come in, the actual finding of the body. 
- - That's a comfort.
  - Well, perhaps dad's right. Maybe we should just drop the subject. Well, thank you. This meeting has actually made me feel better, I think I can handle my mortality a bit better now. Well, enough talk about death. <i>produces a bottle of wine</i> Let's celebrate life with a bottle of Chateau Certair '75 
- - I thought you were all okay about this stuff now.
  - Oh, so did I. What is the matter with me? I guess I thought that putting my affairs in order would help me to deal with this thing, but it hasn't. I... I can't seem to get over the feeling that no matter how remote the possibility, something could happen to me. Jeez, I'd miss so much. I'd never get to see my son hit his first home run. It'd be a terrible thing for a father to miss. 
- - Eddie? Ah, there you are. Come on, boy. Frasier, what are you still doing up? <i>no answer<i> Frasier!
  - Dad, please, shh. I'm trying to listen to my heartbeat. Amazing thing, the human heart. You know, it can pump eighteen hundred gallons of blood through it each and every day, but the tiniest tear in the tiniest part of the tiniest artery and "poof," you're gone. 
- - Tell me about it. Look son, let me tell you something. There was this time, a while back, seven or eight of us were on this drug bust. We get the order to go through the front door, and the first guy took one. He was dead before he hit the ground. When you're a cop, you've got to be able to handle things like that, but I... I just couldn't get over it. Every time I had to go in a blind alley, or in a dark building, I just froze. And I knew if I kept being afraid to die, I'd never be able to do my job. 
  - So what did you do? 
- - I just forced myself to forget about it.
  - Just like that? 
- - Just like that. Next time I came across one of those doors, I went right through it. <i>then<i> The fact that I got shot in the hip was purely coincidental.
  - You were this close to helping me there, Dad. 
- - Look, what do you know about this guy? You don't even know his medical history.
  - Actually, you're on to something there, dad. Yeah, yeah. For all I know he could have had high blood pressure, popped pills, drank like a fish... 
- - Look Frasier, just because some doctor dies doesn't mean you're gonna die.
  - Yes, but he was just like me. Highly educated, sophisticated, at the top of his profession; I saw a picture of him in a medical journal, he even looked like me. Same determined chin, sweater vest and ever-so-slightly receding hairline. 
- - There you go, it could have been any of those things.
  - I'm gonna find out what caused his heart attack. That's the only way I can disassociate myself from him. There's got to be some reasonable explanation. <i>heads towards bedroom</i> That's great, dad. Actually, I do feel better now. 
- - Oh, of course, please come in. I'm Allen Freedman. Gary was my cousin.
  - Dr. Frasier Crane. My sincerest condolences. So, I didn't think Mrs. Newman would have company. 
- - You're not Jewish, are you? It's our version of a wake.
  - Oh &mdash; oh, yes. Oh, of course, of course. I didn't realize that Gary was Jewish, you see. 
- - Oh, the family are sitting Shiva.
  - Excuse me? 
- - You're kidding.
  - Uh, well no. Ah, well, you know, we were pretty close friends, spent a lot of time together &mdash; well, never on Friday nights, of course - but ah, you know, maybe I should come back another time. 
- - No no, please. I'm sure Julie'd love to know that you came. She's right over there. <i>points<i>
  - Oh, she looks busy. I can wait. 
- - You're not Jewish, are you?
  - No, no. My, my ex-wife is, though. And, ah, so and thus my son is. Which makes me, ah, sort of... well I guess you could say... <i>gives up</i> No, I'm not Jewish. 
- - May I help you?
  - Ah. I didn't realize this was a mirror, I thought that maybe you were having an unveiling later. 
- - We always cover mirrors at a Shiva. So those grieving don't have to be concerned with their own appearances.
  - Ah. Ah well, you look very nice. 
- - <i>relieved<i> Oh, thank you. It's been driving me crazy. I'm Bobbie, Gary's aunt.
  - Dr. Frasier Crane. My deepest sympathies. 
- - You're the doctor with the radio show, aren't you?
  - Yes, yes. 
- - Excellent. He was never sick.
  - History of heart disease? 
- - Did you know Gary well?
  - Well, yes. Yes, yes I did. Well I, there's so much more I wanted to know about the man. You see, ah... well oh, I don't know, ah... how was his health before he died? 
- - Oh, no.
  - High blood pressure? 
- - No.
  - High cholesterol? 
- - No.
  - Do you know what his HDL was in comparison to his LDL? 
- - No.
  - I'm sorry. I'm asking too many questions. You know how doctors are, always looking for the answers to the mysteries of life.<i>A woman enters, carrying a cake. She's been crying. Bobbie greets her.</i> 
- - Dr. Crane? From the radio?
  - Yes. I'm sorry for your loss. 
- - I love your show. <i>re her tears<i> Oh, I... I'm sorry about this. It's just, ah, when I went to pick up this linseed tort I thought of Gary and...
  - Oh? So Gary had a fondness for fattening desserts, did he? 
- - Yeah, Gary was a total health fanatic, a strict vegetarian. I used to play basketball with him every Sunday.
  - Oh. Oh, so he was sedentary all week, then he was burning up the court on Sundays. Well, that can be very straining on the heart, you know... 
- - Did you know he had less than 10 percent body fat on him?
  - My goodness. Has anybody checked to see if he's really dead? <i>this does not go down well</i> I'm sure they did check, those people are very thorough. Oh my, is that Krugle? Excuse me. <i>Frasier escapes. He wanders round the room, offering his condolences to people and finds himself standing beside Mrs. Newman.</i>
- - Dr. Crane? From...?
  - Yes, the radio. 
- - Gary never mentioned you.
  - Well, we weren't actually friends. He had an office in my brother's building. 
- - And you took the time to come down here. His own partner didn't even stay fifteen minutes. That's really sweet of you.
  - Well, actually I... there's a reason I came to talk with you. 
- - Which is?
  - It's about Gary. About how he, er... 
- - Yes?<i>Frasier realizes this whole outing has been a bad idea.<i>
  - Look, I'm sorry I've bothered you. Ah, I really just came to offer my sympathies.<i>He starts to get up.</i></i> 
- - Oh no, wait. Um, Dr. Crane? I listen to you all the time, and uh &mdash; well, maybe you can help me? What would you tell someone who called into the show and said they can't get over why someone died? I keep running this over and over in my mind and... I just can't understand how someone like Gary, who did everything right, can just die. I can't make any sense of it.
  - Mrs. Newman, I... I know you'd like me to come up with some grand answer to this whole thing. But I, I don't have one. There are none. Someone who consumes nothing but cigarettes and cheeseburgers all his life can live to be eighty-three, and someone who takes care of himself can die at forty-one. It's unfair. Believe me, there's no explanation for it. Believe me, I've checked. But, I suppose the best we can do is live for the little joys and surprises life affords us. You can't spend your life being obsessed with death. 
- - You're not Jewish, are you?
  - No. No I'm not. Well, thank you for letting me be here today. 
- - Oh, Dr. Crane? It was very nice what you said about living life for the little joys and surprises it can give us.
  - Yes. 
- - Thank you.
  - <i>quietly, to himself</i> If only I believed it myself.<i>He goes to the door, but is stopped by an attractive woman.</i> 
- - I don't know. Eddie - must ya? <i>Eddie carries on staring<i> Apparently he must.
  - <i>to Eddie</i> What is so fascinating about me? What is it? Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some sort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me.<i>Daphne enters carrying a tray of food.</i> 
- - Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the "Weeping Lotus" murder. 
  - Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years. 
- - Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt certain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells me that this case can be cracked. There just must be one small thing I keep overlooking. <i>tidies papers<i>
  - There is - who the murderer was. <i>laughs</i><i>The doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and Martin chat.</i> 
- - It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to stuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing!<i>At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a bottle of wine. He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.<i>
  - Hello, Niles. 
- - Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it shattered her calm.
  - Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high strung? Maybe she should see someone. 
- - No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this "Doctor" and "Mrs. Crane" formality. To you, it's Niles and... <i>stumped<i> er...
  - Maris. 
- - I'm famished.
  - Me, too.<i>Niles and Frasier begin to eat...</i> 
- - We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have blessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together and we also thank you for the other gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able to share with those less fortunate...
  - <i>to Eddie</i> OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING! 
- - So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? You were mentioned.
  - No, I missed it. 
- - Just as well, it wasn't flattering. 
  - I still would have liked to have seen it anyway. 
- - He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the <i>Times<i>. The things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny - what did he say about you?
  - <i>reading</i> "I hate Frasier Crane." 
- - <i>laughs, then<i> Oh, sorry. 
  - That's it. "I hate Frasier Crane." That's it? 
- - Oh, don't let it bother you.
  - Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, it's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in yellow! Now, who would like some wine? 
- - Daphne, this salad is exquisite.
  - <i>sitting down</i> Now why would he say that? 
- - Must be the carrots, he always did like them.
  - Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing like that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is totally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake. 
- - Oh, for crying out loud!
  - Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the trash.<i>Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.</i> 
- - <i>v.o<i> Okay. 
  - All right, good girl. Now your problem...
- - <i>beep<i> Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is trying to get through. Do you mind if I take it? 
  - No, no. Go right ahead. <i>she does</i> Well, certainly a very interesting situation she's got herself into. Don't you think so, Roz?<i>Roz is busy eating and reading magazines. She has to quickly chew her food, put down her books just for the simple</i> 
- - Okay, I'm back. 
  - All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems...
- - <i>beep<i> Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. 
  - For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is popular. <i>laughs</i>
- - Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. <i>beep<i> Oh, I don't believe it - another call. 
  - Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take that other call is the same reason that you want to change your career and break up with your boyfriend. You're obsessed with what you think you're missing. The better offer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on. Fully explore and experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger person for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?
- - Okay, I'm back! 
  - Thank you for your call. <i>hangs up</i> Well, we've only got two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on a personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column. He said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... "I Hate Frasier Crane". <i>sarcastic</i> What trenchant criticism. Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef t'ouerve "I Hate Frasier Crane." A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not our Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. <i>signs off</i><i>Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then "holsters" itin his belt.FADE TO </i>
- - Frasier, how funny running into you here.
  - I'm always here. 
- - Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago have you seen today's "Times"?
  - <i>knowing what's coming</i> No. 
- - Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek Mann's column.
  - You know, this is the second time in as many days that you have given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting yourself a route? 
- - Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. <i>then, to Frasier<i> Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.
  - So I see. <i>reading</i> "Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism of his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes." 
- - Oh, now I remember you!
  - <i>reading</i> "It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show &mdash; his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice a mock- sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult." 
- - It's continued on twelve.
  - I've read enough! 
- - <i>asking<i> Can I get you something?
  - <i>to Niles</i> How can the man think something like that? 
- - It's my job, I'm a waiter.
  - We don't want anything, thank you. 
- - Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a problem with delayed gratification.
  - Well, he's just going to have to wait! I don't know who this Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for what he is not a man at all, but half a man! <i>to Roz</i> Now what line did you say Stewart was on? 
- - He hung up.
  - Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. Let's see who's on line five. <i>he presses button</i> Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening. 
- - <i>v.o<i> Good, because I was listening too.
  - And you are? 
- - Derek Mann.
  - <i>regretting</i> I see. 
- - Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League twit. So what do you say we settle this like men?
  - Are you implying that you want to fight me? 
- - I'm not implying, I'm saying.
  - Fight, as in a fist fight? 
- - <i>v.o<i> So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to fight me or not?
  - Oh, you can't be serious. 
- - Just like I figured, you're chicken.
  - No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject? Who do we have on the line? 
- - You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!
  - I am not chicken! 
- - <i>squawks like a chicken<i>
  - We are mature thinking people, not cavemen! 
- - <i>squawks some more<i>
  - Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! You just say the time and place! 
- - Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!
  - I won't! Don't you back out either because I know where your office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you down! Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!<i>FADE TO</i>
- - He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the door...<i>At this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing tips and a trench coat - it's Frasier.<i>
  - Hello, everyone. 
- - Sometimes I get my signals crossed.
  - What's going on? 
- - You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him. 
  - <i>worried</i> Yes I did, didn't I? 
- - I can't wait to see that.
  - Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad. 
- - What are you talking about?
  - Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I stand to benefit by going through with actually going through with a fist fight? 
- - Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged you and you're backing down?
  - Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to settle their differences. 
- - A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the way I brought you up.
  - Are you encouraging me to fight? 
- - You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.
  - Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even had lunch yet. 
- - I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel all over again.
  - What did you say? 
- - Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.
  - I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty years ago. 
- - Who's this Billy Kreizel?
  - Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me! 
- - So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.
  - Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my blazer! 
- - Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight after school. Only "Patches" here didn't show up!
  - I had a clarinet lesson! 
- - <i>wondering<i> Couldn't you and Billy have met after the clarinet lesson?
  - Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment! 
- - <i>gets up<i> I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a lot in this house. <i>She exits to the kitchen.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation is not the same now. 
- - It's exactly the same.
  - I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a certain position in this city - I do not settle my differences with brawling. 
- - The man challenged you and you accepted. 
  - Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye. 
- - So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say, "Did you get a good look?" And he says, "Not completely, turn around." Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.
  - Roz, why are you telling me this story? 
- - I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and get your clock cleaned.
  - Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win this fight? 
- - <i>enters<i> Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with balloons...
  - All that's missing is a mariachi band. 
- - Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you doing this?
  - It's Billy Kreizel. 
- - <i>looking around<i> Where?
  - <i>shakes head</i> He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten. 
- - I remember.
  - You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is where it stops. I'm not running anymore. 
- - What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?<i>As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket and buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to Frasier which he refuses.<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Chalk it up to random violence!<i>Niles nods in agreement and exits the caf&eacute;. Martin enters.</i> 
- - Hey, there.
  - Dad? What are you doing here? 
- - Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe went over the line.
  - Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do &mdash; well, you're wrong. You can relax. I took this on for myself. 
- - Good.
  - Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway? 
- - Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting a freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. 
  - Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome? 
- - Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. <i>points out of window<i> There, the man standing to the left of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, that's Derek Mann.
  - He's gigantic! 
- - Are you sure you want to go through with this?
  - Yes, yes I am.<i>Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.</i> 
- - <i>begins to leave<i> Well, if we want an unobstructed view...
  - <i>stops him</i> Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You'll only make me nervous. 
- - They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.<i>Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. The officer marches Frasier right into the Caf&eacute;.<i>
  - Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my jacket.
- - Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in this town we don't settle our differences with street fights - no matter who you are. 
  - Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.
- - Okay. <i>exits<i>
  - Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... God, I feel great! 
- - You did good.
  - Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that... 
- - We have Gary from Issiqua on line two. He and his wife had a big fight.
  - Sorry to hear that, Gar. I'm listening. 
- - <i>v.o.<i> Well, y'see, Dr. Crane, my wife is hell-bent on going to Italy this year.
  - Ahh, Italia - the rolling hills of Toscana, the art of Firenze, the passion that is Venizia... 
- - <i>over his head<i> Yeah, well, anyway - I like taking vacations as much as the next guy but I say that, if we dip into our savings, I think the first thing we should buy is a new sump-pump for the basement. At least with that-
  - <i>interrupting</i> Oh, listen, Gary. Let me stop you right there. I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with your wife on this one. 
- - But the trip to Italy costs eighteen hundred bucks, and that doesn't include the "Splendours of the Vatican" package.
  - Gary, there is more to life than sump-pumps. Whatever happened to feeding our souls? Look, for example, I recently purchased a painting by one of this country's premier artists&mdash; oh, it's not important who. Well, it's Seattle's own Martha Paxton, but... Practical? No. But ever since acquiring that painting, I look at it every day and there's not a moment when I do that I'm not uplifted by its beauty. So Gary, go to Italy, bring back a suitcase full of memories. Will you do that? 
- - I still think I should get the sump-pump.
  - <i>contemptuous</i> Well then, yes, Gary, you... you should get the sump-pump! We'll be right back after this newsbreak.<i>Frasier is now off-air and moves through to Roz in the control booth.</i>
- - If you need one, you'll know. Listen, do you really own a Paxton or were you just blowing sunshine up old Gary's skirt?
  - Yes indeed, I do own a Paxton. 
- - Well, you'll be pleased to know that she's on line three. <i>holds up the phone<i>
  - <i>gasps and snatches the phone</i> My God, Roz, she's the preeminent Neofauvist of the twentieth century! How could you put her on hold? 
- - Well, the phone rang and I pushed the little button-<i>He gestures for her to push the little button again.<i>
  - Yes, hello, Miss Paxton. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Well, thank you. I'm very flattered that you listen to my little show. Yes, well, yes, I meant every word. Yes, that's lovely, I'd like to meet you, too sometime. <i>sudden thought</i> As a matter of fact, I'm having a few friends over for a little gathering this Friday night, for cocktails and such. Well, I suppose you're far too busy to... you would! Oh, that's marvelous. Alright, that's the Elliot Bay towers on the Counterbalance. Around seven is just fine. And, well, I'll see then then. <i>Ciao!</i> <i>hangs up</i> 
- - Well, my theory on death is first you're whisked down a long dark tunnel towards a beautiful white light; you suddenly get all the jokes you never got before, you let out a little chuckle, and then you die!<i>The clique laughs.<i>
  - That's a delightful story, Daphne, but I think the toast points need replenishing. 
- - <i>hops down<i> Enchanting, just enchanting.
  - My God, Niles, why is no-one eating the Mussoline of Duck?<i>Eddie hops onto the chair and starts eating it.</i>
- - Well, now we know why.<i>Frasier tidies up the duck and nervously licks his fingers clean.<i>
  - Look, Niles, the dog is eating the food, the pianist is too intrusive, the Pinot Noir is far too stagey and it's five past seven and Martha isn't even here yet! 
- - I'm not going to have to sedate you, am I?
  - No, I'm just a bit on edge, I want everything to be so perfect. <i>pause</i> By the way, where's Maris? I haven't seen her all night. 
- - She's on your bed.
  - My bed? 
- - Yes, she's asleep under the guests' coats. She exhausts easily under the pressure to be interesting.
  - Niles, she's supposed to be looking after dad. That's the only reason you're here, remember? 
- - Dad is in the bathroom - don't worry.<i>Doorbell rings.<i>
  - That must be la Paxton - and fashionably late, of course. <i>He opens the door. It's Roz.</i> 
- - I look like crap - I've got a spot on my dress, I over-plucked one eyebrow and the crotch of my pantyhose is creeping down to my knees.<i>To Frasier's horror she squats behind the table next to the couch and pulls them up.<i>
  - Couldn't you have just done that in the elevator? <i>takes her coat</i> Oh, my goodness, Roz, you've got a neck. Gee, so what do you think of the place? Is it everything you imagined it would be? 
- - Well, to be frank, Frasier, I don't spend my idle hours imagining how you live. But I did expect lots of beige and, look, I was right.
  - Would you like a drink? 
- - So, Frasier, which one is your dad?
  - Oh, well, he's the older gentleman over there talking to Bethany van Pelt, showing her the photographs. <i>realises</i> Oh my God!<i>He rushes over to them.</i> 
- - <i>re photos<i> ...and when we finally got to her it was only hanging by two tendons.
  - <i>to Bethany, who looks ill</i> Would you excuse us, please? <i>leads his dad away</i> Dad, will you stop showing these crime scene photos? You're embarrassing me. 
- - Oh, these society people eat this up. Besides, she was the one that brought it up.
  - Oh, she brought it up? Bethany van Pelt - the head of the Junior League - brought up the subject of a hooker whose body was hideously dismembered and scattered all over an abandoned warehouse. 
- - Yeah, she asked, "aren't these Swedish meatballs the messiest things you've ever seen?" and I said, "no, as a matter of fact"-
  - Dad, dad, please! 
- - Alright, alright, but stop shadowing me. I don't need a nursemaid.
  - Alright, if you give me your word, that's good enough for me. <i>He passes Niles, who is following Daphne out of the kitchen.</i>
- - Dr. Crane? I'm Martha Paxton.
  - Of course, who else could you be? Welcome to my salon. <i>loudly</i> Everyone, everyone, your attention, please. I'd like you all to welcome our guest of honour, the renowned artist - Martha Paxton.<i>The guests applaud.</i>
- - No, no, no, no, I never take it off at parties. It gives me an excuse not to shake hands with people.
  - Oh, how delightfully eccentric! You must meet my brother, Niles. Oh, Niles? 
- - Now, where did you hang my painting? I'm always curious to know how people live with my work.
  - Live with my work - I love that phrase. If you would, right this way, please. <i>leads her towards the centre of the room</i> I think this is the perfect spot for an ideal viewing. Oh God, I've waited so long for this moment - I'm just going to stand back and let you describe your work - "Elegy in Green"&mdash; in your own words. The way you insinuate the palette but never lean on it, you capture the <i>zeitgeist</i> of our generation. It is the most perfect canvas it has ever my privilege to gaze upon. I mean, one can only imagine what inspired you to paint it. 
- - I didn't paint it.<i>A murmur passes through the crowd.<i>
  - <i>fighting panic</i> Of course you didn't. You-you created it, you gave birth to it. 
- - I really liked your friend Roz. 
  - What? 
- - Roz, at the party tonight. Nice gal. Why don't you ask her out? She's great-looking and she can really hold her liquor.
  - Dad, do you mind? I've just suffered the most humiliating evening of my life. I've been been made a fool of by this, this, this... thing. <i>gestures towards the painting</i> 
- - You know, I may be just a girl from Manchester but, I have to tell you, even though it's not a Paxton, I really like that picture. I liked it the minute I saw it. I liked it even before I knew who Martha Paxton was. And quite frankly, I don't think that woman bathes.
  - Well, enjoy it while you can because, first thing in the morning, this is going back to the dealer where I bought it. I'm demanding my money back - no-one is going to take advantage of Frasier Crane. 
- - You know, listen, Frasier. You're kind of upset about this, maybe I should return it for you.
  - Well, Dad, I appreciate the gesture but, really, what do you know about the art world? 
- - I can see the love in your eyes. You must have this painting.
  - Are you the owner?
- - Yes, I am. Phillip Hayson. <i>they shake hands<i>
  - How do you do, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. I happen - 
- - No, not <i>the<i> Dr. Frasier Crane. From the radio? 
  - Guilty. Yes, but - 
- - My wife and I love your show! Could I have your autograph before you go?
  - It would be my pleasure but, speaking of autographs, I have a small problem with this painting. <i>holds up painting</i>
- - I'm really distressed to hear that. Would you like a glass of wine?
  - Well, actually I -
- - My wife and I toured the Loire valley last year and we couldn't resist buying four cases of this. <i>opens the bottle and pours Frasier a glass<i> It's really quite extraordinary - I hope you like it. 
  - Well, I'd really rather not have any wine at this moment -<i>Phillip lets Frasier taste the wine.</i>
- - Very well. Would you like some more?
  - No, no, no, thank you. I'd... getting back to my problem - I recently gave a small but elegant soiree at which Martha Paxton was in attendance, you see. She told me that this painting was not her work. 
- - Oh dear, I can imagine how embarrassing that must have been.
  - I doubt you can, Mr. Hayson.
- - Oh, I remember - 
  - Yes, I'm sure she was but, you see, it's <i>not</i> a Paxton!
- - But it says right here that it <i>is<i> a Paxton. The signature is here. <i>The three bend to point at the signature<i>
  - Martha Paxton says that it is not a Paxton.
- - Oh, Martha, how is the old dear? Her and I go back a long way, is she still-? <i>makes a gesture to his hair - a reference to Paxton's baldness<i>
  - As a Crenshaw melon, yes.
- - Would you like a little more wine?
  - No, I don't want any wine. I want to discuss this painting.
- - So would I. Maybe some brie? <i>Ronald and Diane disappear<i>
  - No, I don't want any brie! I want my money back.
- - Oh, well, that's where things might get a bit... prickly. You see, we have a strict policy here at the Hayson gallery - all sales are final. 
  - But, in this case, you're willing to make an exception.
- - Oh, I'd love to, but I can't.
  - Yes, but it's a forgery.
- - Well, if it is, it's a damn good one. <i>laughs<i>
  - Alright, alright, I'm going to make this simple - I want my money.
- - I'm sure you do.
  - Oh, I know what you're doing - you're "handling" me. You're agreeing with everything I say hoping I'll tire and go away.
- - Whatever you say.
  - I don't believe it! You're shining me on. You are shining me on! Where is the fairness of this, where is the justice?!
- - What are you still doing with that? I thought you were going to return it.
  - They wouldn't take it back. All I got was some attitude and a cheap glass of wine - Loire valley, my ass. 
- - What are you going to do now?
  - Well, they've forced my hand. I'm going to call the police. <i>picks up the phone</i> 
- - Five-five-five three thousand.
  - Thanks, Dad. Try to mess with Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll teach them. <i>into phone</i> Hello, yes. Oh, just a second. <i>to Martin</i> Dad, who do I ask for? 
- - Have them put you through to the fine arts forgery department.
  - <i>into phone</i> Hello, yes, the fine arts forgery department, please. <i>At the table, Martin hides his grin while Frasier gets a sour look.</i>
- - <i>chuckling<i> Give me the phone. <i>Frasier does<i> Hi, who's this? Hey, Doris. Yeah, Marty Crane. Yeah, that was my son. Yeah, I just thought he needed a bite of a reality sandwich. Yeah, yeah, give my best to the guys. Thanks. Bye. <i>hangs up<i>
  - What was that? 
- - Frasier, the boys downtown have their hands full of murders and robberies - they don't have time for this artsy-fartsy stuff.
  - Yes, Dad, but what am I supposed to do? I've been cheated!<i>Niles and Daphne emerge from Frasier's bedroom, both are disheveled and appear straightening their clothes.</i>
- - Maris lost her earring at the party last night. Daphne was good enough to crawl under the bed to look for it while I...
  - <i>long and low</i> Yeeeess? 
- - Maybe I'll go check in the hallway. It might have gotten trampled into the carpet when everybody stampeded for the elevator.
  - No one stampeded! They were all just good guests, they knew when to leave. 
- - Two hours early. <i>laughs<i>
  - Oh, shut up, Niles! 
- - <i>sees the painting<i> Oh, I see. Am I to ascribe this foul mood to the fact that you were unable to unload the bogus Paxton?
  - Yes. Gee, I know, Niles. What is the name of that really vicious lawyer that you use? 
- - Which one, the one I used to sue the contractor or the one I used to sue the personal trainer?
  - Well, the meanest. 
- - Uh, that would be the second one. I used him to sue the first one.
  - Right. <i>picks up the phone</i> Ah, just give me his number, will you? 
- - He's right about that.
  - <i>replaces the phone</i> God, I hate laywers! 
- - Oh, me too. <i>sits down on the couch<i> But they make wonderful patients. They have excellent health insurance and they never get better.
  - Say, I know, I know. I can use my radio show - why didn't I think of this earlier? I can use my bully pulpit to expose that man for the fraud that he is! 
- - Now, Frasier, that's slander. He'll sue you for everything you've got.
  - Damn it, Niles, where is the justice? Where am I supposed to turn to? I'm a, a beloved household personality and I've been screwed! <i>gestures at the painting</i> 
- - <i>as he returns from the kitchen<i> For God's sake, Frasier, you're forty-one years old. It's time you learned something the system ain't perfect. Sometimes the bad guy wins. And all those things you thought would be around to help you, the courts and the police department? Well, sometimes they're just not there when you need them. So you can either let it eat a hole in your stomach, or you can just file it away under the heading, "Sometimes Life Sucks." <i>exits to his room<i>
  - <i>shouts after him</i> Yeah well, that file's getting pretty thick!<i>Niles returns from the bar with two sherries. He hands one to Frasier.</i>
- - <i>through car window<i> Get in the car.
  - Niles, what the hell are you doing here? 
- - Stopping you from doing something really stupid. Now get in the car.
  - I will not! Niles, look, I know this is wrong but I don't care! It's the only thing left for me! 
- - Alright, Frasier. <i>steps out of the car; Frasier retreats<i> Frasier, just give me the brick and no one will get hurt.
  - Why don't you just go away? This is no concern of yours. 
- - Yes, it is.
  - How? 
- - Remember that day in junior high school when somebody took all my clothes while I was in the shower, right after gym class? They hung them from the goalpost on the football field. I had no choice but to get a ladder and climb up there wearing nothing but a towel, wet and shivering. Then the towel fell off! There I was - your little brother, hanging naked from a goal post, and everyone was standing around laughing, and all Coach Medwick would do was stand there going- <i>holds his arms up to imitate the gesture<i> whatever that means.<i>N.B. In American football, the signal - raising the arms to vertical and then dropping them to a "Y" position - means "field goal!" when a player scores by kicking the ball over and through the goal post.<i>
  - Niles, why are you telling me this? 
- - Because - I was so humiliated, I went home, I cried my eyes out, I swore I would get even. I was just about to put sugar into Coach Medwick's gas tank... and you stopped me. Remember what you said? "If you act like a barbarian, you will become a barbarian."
  - I said that? 
- - Give me the brick, Frasier.
  - <i>frustrated</i> And let him get away with this?! 
- - I know, I know! What the gallery owner did to you was wrong, it was humiliating. But if you throw that brick through that window, you will have lost something more valuable than your money. You will have lost... your mind. Frasier, you can't do this!
  - Well, Niles, if you were strong enough to show restraint after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames. 
- - <i>as if remembering<i> Nicknames. <i>then<i> There were nicknames?
  - Oh, you didn't know that? Oh dear God, yes. Uh, "Peachfuzz," "Jingle Bells" - I can't remember the rest. 
- - Peachfuzz?
  - Yes, I believe Coach Medwick made that one up himself. <i>hands Niles the brick</i> Well, anyway, here you are. I won't be needing this anymore. 
- - I'm proud of you.<i>Frasier heads towards the car but Niles does not join him. Instead, he cocks his arm and hurls the brick through the gallery window,shattering it with a loud crash. As the alarm sounds, Niles throws his hands up in a gesture reminiscient of the Coach Medwick signal.<i>
  - <i>shouts above the alarm</i> My God, Niles! What are you, what have you done?! 
- - <i>proud<i> I've struck a blow for justice! Nobody calls me "Peachfuzz." Now let's get the hell out of here. <i>They both run to the car, but as Frasier dashes to the passenger side, Niles stops and runs back to the window with his wallet out.<i>
  - Niles, what are you doing now? 
- - We may be barbarians, but we pay for our pillaging! <i>He throws a handful of notes in through the broken window.<i>
  - Come on, come on! <i>Niles gets into the car</i> GO, GO, GO, GO!<i>Niles's tires squeal as he speeds away from the gallery.</i><i>End Of Act Two.</i>
- - <i>v.o.; strong French accent<i> I'm sorry, Dr. Crane. I'm having a big, big problem with my monsieur. 
  - Excuse me, with your what?
- - My monsieur. 
  - Your mithyuer? <i>Both he and Roz are perplexed. Apparently, his knowledge of French begins and ends with wine bottle labels.</i>
- - Oui, my monsieur. Every day... 
  - Is that your mother?
- - No. My monsieur. 
  - Your masseur? Your Mercedes?
- - Monsieur! My monsieur! You must help me. 
  - Well Danielle, I, I, um... the best advice I can give you is to umm... either confront your mithyuer, or um, work on your self-esteem. Thank you for your call. <i>hangs up</i> This is Dr. Frasier Crane, saying go out and have a good night, Seattle. You deserve it. <i>He goes off the air, then goes into Roz's booth.</i>
- - Yeah. But when you only have one, you get a little less particular.
  - <i>admiring Roz</i> You look nice. 
- - Yeah? Well, I've got a date tonight.
  - Oh, great... Why are you only wearing one heel? Did you break it off? 
- - No, I'm dating a sea-captain with a peg-leg and this makes it easier when we dance. <i>then<i> I broke it off in a sidewalk grate.
  - Okay, so who is this guy? Another one of those trendy young kids who's got three earrings and a ponytail, wearing a T-shirt under his sports coat? 
- - Is he here?
  - Roz! Where do you meet these people? 
- - For your information, this guy happens to be a very successful media consultant. He graduated from Princeton, he has a house on Mercer Island and he owns a forty-foot sailboat.
  - You met him on a bus, didn't you? 
- - Hello, Frasier.
  - Hi, Niles. You remember Roz? 
- - Good luck. <i>to Frasier<i> Sorry I'm late, Frasier, but the entrance to your parking garage is blocked by a cab driver with a ponytail, scraping gum off his back seat.
  - <i>to Roz</i> Madame, your chariot awaits. <i>Roz exits</i> Well, we better get going, Niles. 
- - Oh actually, bad news on that score, Frasier. I'm afraid the lecture's been cancelled.
  - Oh. Well, I can't say I'm really disappointed. I wasn't relishing the idea of three hours on "Right brain, Left brain synergy." 
- - I'll have you know I trimmed that speech to two and a half hours and I opened with a really funny Al Gore joke.
  - Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk. Now... we've got a free evening. This sound like the perfect opportunity for a couple of guys on the loose to, ah... hit a sports bar, have a couple of brewskis, maybe take in a game or two. 
- - Right. What shall we do?
  - Dinner? 
- - Perfect. No place fancy, I'm sure neither of us wants a heavy meal with lots of wine and expensive desserts.
  - Oh, it's your turn to pay, isn't it? 
- - Thank you. 
  - Thank you. 
- - Are you sure it's all right to park in that lot across the street? The sign says it was just for customers of those stores, I don't want to get a ticket. 
  - No, it's fine, Niles. 
- - I mean, I could get just nip back to Crabtree & Evelyn and buy a bar of lavender soap, just to be safe. <i>stands<i> 
  - Oh Niles, Niles. Sit down. Lavender soap - for God's sake, you're a man, you'd look ridiculous.
- - Can I get you a drink? 
  - Fuzzy Navel, blended nice and frothy, please. And a... martini, Niles? 
- - No thanks, I'm driving. <i>he's still worried about his car<i> Maybe I'll buy a bag of Potpourri, or a set of hand towels. 
  - Just sit down. <i>Suddenly Niles spots Martin at another table, with a woman.</i> 
- - Frasier. Unless my eyes deceive me, that's Dad sitting over there.
  - God, you're right. Gee, that's strange, he said he was going over to Duke's to have a beer with a couple of the boys. 
- - Well, that certainly isn't the boys. Seems we've caught him in a clandestine rendezvous.
  - The sly boots. He had a date, and he didn't want us to know. 
- - Oh, he's looking this way, turn around, turn around!<i>They both hide behind their menus.<i>
  - What are they doing? 
- - <i>peeking<i> Well, it's sort of cute. He's holding her hand. <i>Frasier risks a peek<i> Don't look, don't look. I'll tell you when you can look. Not now... Not now... Okay, now. <i>Frasier looks<i> No, not now! <i>Frasier hides again<i> Oh, I don't like this one bit. 
  - Why, what are they doing now? 
- - Oh nothing, I just realized if Dad's eating here this can't be a very good restaurant.
  - You know, I wonder if it's their first date? 
- - Well, if it is, they seem to be having a very good time.
  - Why, what are they doing? 
- - Well, they're leaning in and talking to each other. He's smiling at her, she's... just collapsed in tears, she's sobbing uncontrollably.
  - Oh, yeah. That's a Crane first date all right.<i>The woman gets up and goes to the rest room.</i> 
- - She's coming this way, hide. <i>the woman passes their table<i> Frasier, do you know who that is?
  - She did look familiar. 
- - I'd swear that was Marion Lawler.
  - Marion Lawler? My God, I haven't heard that name since I was a kid. 
- - I thought Mom and Dad had a huge falling-out with the Lawlers.
  - They did, they did. It was that last summer we shared a cabin with them at the lake. 
- - Well, maybe Dad's getting together just to patch things up.
  - And doing his usual bang-up job. 
- - This is really awkward. We should just get out of here.
  - No, Niles. If we leave now, he's sure to spot us. <i>looks out the window</i> You know, Niles, maybe you should have that martini after all. 
- - I can't drink, Frasier. I'm driving.
  - Not anymore, they just towed your car.<i>Niles nods, then starts and looks out the window. He buries his head.FADE TO</i>
- - Eddie, you little hooligan. Get off that couch. You know you're not supposed to do that. If Dr. Crane sees you, he's going to throw you off the balcony and I'll be right behind you. <i>puts Eddie on the floor<i> Good boy. Now just stay there.<i>As soon as she leaves, Eddie jumps back up and starts rolling again. Frasier enters. Eddie immediately sits on the floor before Frasier sees him.<i>
  - Well, Eddie. Glad to see my rules about the couch are finally taking hold. <i>He reaches out to pet Eddie, then ends up patting him on the nose. </i>
- - <i>entering<i> Oh, hello Dr. Crane.
  - Hello, Daphne. Say, where's Dad? 
- - Mr. Dawcy down on eight invited him over to watch the ball game.
  - Oh, great. He's finally getting to know some of the neighbors.<i>He notices her looking at his face, her head cocked to the side.</i>
- - Have you ever thought about growing a moustache?
  - No, I don't think it would suit me. 
- - Oh, yes it does.
  - You've never seen me with one. 
- - Actually, I have. There's a billboard for your show down on Sixteenth Street. Some kids went at you with a can of spray paint. 
  - And it looked good? 
- - A rental car, thanks to my brother.
  - I assume you're here for a reason? 
- - Ah, yes. Frasier, last night when I got home, that strange incident with Dad and Mrs. Lawler got me to thinking, what was it that caused the rift between our two families? So, I dug out my old boyhood journal, <i>produces it<i> and looked up my entries from our last summer together at the lake. According to this, there was a three-week period where Mom and Dad had screaming matches every night, after we went to bed.
  - I don't recall that. 
- - Oh, that's right. That was the same period where you insisted on wearing the wax earplugs and the slumber mask.
  - Well, I had to, what with you underneath the covers with a flashlight looking at the <i>National Geographic.</i> 
- - I was looking at the maps.
  - That's what makes it so scary. Now what was your point? 
- - Well, according to my journal, something more provocative happened during that same period. Here, read this. <i>hands over book<i>
  - <i>reading</i> "Though summer at the lake seems but a vapid, vacuous experience, it is a necessary tonic for my troubled youth..." Niles, how old were you when you wrote this? 
- - Almost nine. Which explains the redundancy &mdash; "Vapid" and "Vacuous."
  - Well... 
- - By ten, my writing had gotten considerably tighter.
  - Amongst other things. 
- - The point is, that same night I crept out onto the screen porch, leaving the lights off so not to attract bats and moths. As I peered out through the darkness, between the trees I saw the figures of Dad and Mrs. Lawler in each other's arms. I think it's pretty clear what happened, Frasier. Dad and Mrs. Lawler had an affair.
  - Oh, come on, Niles. Look, I appreciate your attempt to spice up our family history, but really - look, we're not a Jackie Collins novel, it's ridiculous. 
- - Ooh, I love to see old family photos. <i>looks<i> My goodness&mdash; what a handsome, sinewy young bloke.
  - Yeah, that was our dad. 
- - <i>for it is he<i> I was under doctor's orders to stay out of direct sunlight.
  - Look, we don't know for sure if that was Mrs. Lawler. And besides, even then it wouldn't prove that Dad had an affair with her. 
- - What are you two talking about?
  - Oh, Niles has this theory that Dad had an illicit affair when we were youngsters. 
- - Your father? I can't believe that, he's not the type.
  - Well, that's what I think. Besides Niles, there's not enough proof. 
- - Well, are you saying it's not possible?
  - Oh, anything is possible. 
- - Then why don't you just ask him?
  - Right. "Good evening, father. By the way, did you boff one of the neighbors while we were roasting marshmallows?" 
- - Ah, ah. There's one sure way to get the truth. We'll call Aunt Vivian. <i>goes to phone<i>
  - Oh, no. 
- - Better known as The Mouth. Keeper of the Crane family skeletons.
  - <i>takes phone from Niles</i> No, Niles, we are not calling Aunt Vivian. 
- - Why? Are you scared you'll find out something you don't want to know?
  - Yes. That she knows where I live and that she still drives. 
- - Well, last night... Frasier saw you having dinner with Marion Lawler.
  - You were with me! 
- - So what were you doing, spying on me?
  - No, no Dad, we were just having dinner together - at the same time when you were supposed to be having some drinks with your buddies at Duke's. 
- - And that proves I had an affair thirty years ago?
  - No, no. But Niles dug out his journal and then he remembered this time when he saw you and her hugging, and it was right around the same time when you and Mom seemed to be fighting a lot. 
- - <i>sitting<i> Good, you're here. I came by to see how you're doing, but I only have a few minutes. I start my "Healing with Humor" support group tonight, and I still have to pick up my big shoes.
  - How am I doing? How are you doing, Niles? Doesn't it bother you that your father cheated on my mother? 
- - Frasier, your loyalties are seeping through, and I might point out that I got Mom's small features, while you got Dad's chunky thighs.
  - The point is, that it must have caused Mom a great deal of pain. 
- - Agreed, but they went on and had a very happy life together. They got over it. Why can't you?
  - I know that rationally I should be able to handle this. I deal with people who exemplify human frailty every day. <i>Another customer starts browsing in the bookcase behind the brothers.</i>
- - Frasier, as your brother, as a therapist, I think you have to let this go. And a good first step would be to come with me to my "Healing with Humor" support group.
  - Thank you Niles, but I think I just need a night to myself. 
- - Frasier?
  - <i>coldly</i> Yes. 
- - You may not remember me. Marion Lawler.
  - Yes, I remember you. <i>they shake hands</i> 
- - Is your dad home?
  - Ah, no. but if you come back later you can have the place to yourselves. 
- - No, that's not necessary. I had dinner with him the other night, and I left rather abruptly. I just wanted to tell him I'm sorry. Would you please give him my best?
  - Oh, I think you've already done that. 
- - Did I come at a bad time? You seem upset.
  - Would you come in for a moment, please? <i>she enters</i> After you met with Dad the other night, ah, he and I had a little conversation. That was the first time I learned what happened that summer. 
- - Oh, I'm sorry.
  - Well... I guess I'm not the sort of person who can hear news like that and just sweep it under the rug and forget about it. 
- - I know you're upset. But if it's any consolation, in time your father and I forgave them.
  - <i>suddenly realizing</i> Forgave <u>them</u>? 
- - Frasier, your mother was a good person. So was my husband. They made a mistake. Anyway, just tell your father I stopped by. I felt so silly crying in front of him the other night. I've been a little overemotional since Dan died.
  - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. 
- - Well, you never know how hard that's going to hit you. Look who I'm telling this to - the famous radio psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane. I remember you when you used to run around in your undies with your pail and shovel.
  - Yes, well I rarely get to the shore anymore. 
- - Well... goodbye, Frasier.
  - Goodbye.<i>Marion leaves. Frasier closes the door, looking heartsick.FADE TO</i>

  - Hi, Dad. You look kinda tired. 
- - <i>settling into chair, turning on TV<i> Yeah. Just finished my exercises with Nurse Ratchet.
  - Ah, listen Dad, do you have to watch the TV right now? 
- - Yeah, my program's on.
  - Well, you know, if either of us could work the VCR, we'd tape it. But, ah, just for now there's something I'd like to talk to you about. <i>turns off TV</i> 
- - Oh, for God's sake, Frasier. I know what this is, I've already told you everything I'm going to. Now drop it.<i>Martin turns on the chair's vibrating system. Frasier unplugs it.<i>
  - Dad. Why didn't you tell me the truth? 
- - I did.
  - Marion Lawler came by today. She wanted to apologize for the other night. While she was here, she... she told me what really happened. 
- - Alright, so now you know. You did your little digging, and you stuck your nose in where it didn't belong, are you happy now?
  - Why didn't you tell me it was Mom? 
- - Because it's none of your damn business, and it still isn't.
  - Look dad, I don't blame you for being defensive, but I had a right to know. For your information, this sort of thing happens to a lot of people. If it's any consolation, I know exactly how you feel. I never told you this but, um... Lilith did the same thing to me. 
- - Lilith had an affair?
  - The most painful and humiliating experience of my entire life. Well, I'm sure you felt the same way. 
- - Well, I hadn't thought about it for quite some time, but thanks for reminding me. <i>starts laughing<i> Lilith?
  - I found her attractive. I mean, is it so inconceivable that another man might find her attractive as well? 
- - <i>not convinced<i> I guess. So who was the bozo in your case?
  - Oh, God. A Frenchman who lived in a self-contained underground eco-pod. 
- - Well, that still sounds better than a urologist with a bad comb-over.
  - I'm sorry, dad. 
- - Look son, do me a favor. Don't hate your mother for this. I wasn't the easiest person to live with back then, and she had plenty of reason to do what she did. Luckily we were able to put it behind us, but I'll tell you... there were times when it really tore me up. I loved your mother.
  - So did I. 
- - I'm sorry. That's why I said I was the one who had the affair. I was just trying to protect her. Hey, me you already had problems with.
  - Well dad, I appreciate what you did, but ah, I still think you should have told me. 
- - Okay. Can I watch my program now?
  - Oh, no. Just one second. <i>gets the photo album</i> There's one thing I gotta clear up. There's this photo album here, there's all these pictures with the same woman that's been cut out of them, you see this? 
- - What else do you notice, Sherlock? Like, where's your mother?
  - Oh. Oh, that was mom? 
- - She cut herself out of it. She put a few pounds on that summer. I think that day she was wearing a brown dress with a belt, and your Aunt Vivian told her she looked like a knockwurst tied in the middle.
  - You know dad, ever since you moved in we've been trying to find something that we have in common. I think we've finally found it. 
- - Yeah... wish it was a birthmark.
  - So do I.<i>Frasier goes to his room. Martin turns on the TV.End of Act Two (Time 0930)</i>

  - Yes, you are on the air. 
- - Hello, am I on?
  - Hank, listen. Turn down your radio and just talk into your phone.

- - Well, I uh, I started seeing this woman two years ago. I think it was two years. Um, it was around Thanksgiving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. The leaves were off the trees and the...
  - Close enough. What is your problem, Marco? 
- - Well, it's not really my problem, it's more like her problem. Lately she keeps pressing me for a commitment.
  - What's holding you back? 
- - I don't know, I just... I guess I just want to keep my options open. You know, in case somebody better comes along.
  - Somebody better comes along. Somebody better comes along?! Marco, Marco, Marco, do you hear yourself? 
- - No, I turned my radio off after you blasted that other guy.
  - Well listen, I suggest you give your motives a thorough examination, and if you can't commit, it's best for both of you to break it off. Thank you for your call. <i>hangs up</i> Tell me listeners, what is it with guys like that? Hey Roz, you've been around the block a few times. You ever run into a guy like Marco? 
- - Oh, they're all Marcos. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Marco.
  - Come on. I mean, if that were so, then no-one would be having a relationship. 
- - Well, I'm not. My sister's not. None of my friends are. I've seen the future, and its name is Marco.
  - What do you think, Seattle? Are there any non-Marcos out there? Or is Roz here destined to live a life of hopeless, loveless spinsterhood? Back after this.<i>He goes off the air.</i>

  - No, look, the days are past when you can just sit me on top of some stupid old Packard and make me wear matching sweaters with my little brother.

- - Wait a minute, don't walk away from me. For once you're going to face the consequences of what happens after you hang up on your callers. 
  - What consequences? What are you talking about?
- - I'm Marco's girlfriend. Excuse me - ex-girlfriend, thanks to you. 
  - Marco? You mean the Marco who-didn't-want-to-commit Marco? <i>He goes into the booth and she follows him.</i>
- - Ah, you damn radio shrinks! You couldn't just tell him to stick with it. That kind of advice doesn't get big ratings. No, "break up with her, get on with your life and ruin hers." Now that's entertainment. 
  - Now just hold on one minute. Did you actually listen to the show?
- - ...No. But Marco told me what you said. 
  - Oh he did, did he? Did he also mention that he said that he was only staying with you to "keep his options open?" Because that's what he told me. To be exact, he said he was only staying with you "until somebody better came along."
- - He said that? 
  - He said that to most of Seattle. Apparently you're the only one who missed it.
- - So, it wasn't that he didn't want to commit. He just didn't want to commit to me. <i>starts to cry<i> 
  - Well I'm... I'm terribly sorry I had to tell you. But, um, at least now you know the truth. Oh, no-no-no, don't cry. You're in a place of business here. <i>With his usual tact, he places a folder over the mike to protect it from her tears.</i>

- - Thank you. <i>sits crossed-legged<i> 
  - But listen, if... if he was that resistant, why did you stay with him?
- - I had a lot invested in him. 
  - Yes, but that's no reason to settle for someone who isn't madly in love with you.
- - Well, right now I'm not sure there are any men out there who are actually capable of falling madly in love. 
  - Of course there are. You know, at the most basic level men and women are the same. We both need to be loved, and to love someone, we both want to feel that we matter to someone and that someone matters to us. And making a commitment to another human being is the ultimate expression of our humanity.
- - Oh, boy. Why are relationships always so hard? Hey, <i>indicating Frasier's choice of M&M<i> you like the yellow ones too, huh? 
  - Yeah. You know, people try to tell you they're the same but...
- - Wow. Your wife is really lucky. 
  - I'm sure she'd say the same thing, especially now that our marriage is over... well, maybe I will have one of those M&M's. <i>takes packet, helps himself</i>
- - I know. 
  - But they're not.
- - No. 
  - Well, you know, relationships don't always have to be so hard. I remember back in med school, I heard of a documented case where a man and a woman met, got along, and actually lived happily ever after.
- - Yeah, I don't mind the happily ever after part. It's the dating part. If I have to tell one more stranger the fascinating story of my life over more Italian cuisine I'm gonna choke on a breadstick! 
  - <i>laughs, then sits crossed-legged as well, mimicking her</i> I know. You know, I just keep thinking that maybe we can just resume this over appetizers. 
- - Oh, no, no. Half the time I'm ready to exchange goodbyes over appetizers. 
  - Well, at least you don't get stuck with the bill.
- - God, you haven't dated much lately, have you? 
  - No. I usually end up in restaurants alone.
- - Oh, I can't do that. I even have to turn on the TV at home so at least it feels that there's someone else in the room. 
  - Is that what you'll be doing tonight?
- - Mmm. I'm late. I gotta go to work. 
  - Oh, wait, wait. We haven't decided what we're gonna do tonight. Ah, Antonio's? Le Cigar Volante?
- - We've gone out for the last three nights, why don't we just stay in, huh? 
  - That's a great idea. I'll tell you what. I'll uh, send dad and Daphne off to the movies. I'll cook for you. Be at my place at eight.
- - Oh, I won't be able to make it 'til eight-thirty, I gotta change, okay? 
  - Oh, no-no-no-no. Don't ever change - I like you just the way you are. <i>everybody in the Cafe groans; to group</i> Oh, come on, come on, I'm a little out of practice.

  - Marco is not a patient, he's a caller. There's a huge difference. Besides, I talked to him days before I met Catherine. 
- - Mmm, rationalization - the last refuge of the unsound argument.
  - Oh, rationalization, is that what you're going pull now? <i>They argue for a few moments.</i> 
- - As long as your conscience is clear. I'm not sure mine would be.

  - Did you, ah... get a good look at the guy? 
- - No. It was too dark. I think I made a big mistake, Doc. Do you think I should ask her to take me back?
  - No! What I mean is, ah... no. Marco, you don't want your ex- girlfriend back, you just don't want anybody else to have her. Isn't that true? 
- - Well, I...
  - No, it's called jealousy, Marco. Now you've got to stop spying on your ex-girlfriend and get on with your life. Borrow a page from my book - ah, move to a new city, a new state.

  - I see. 
- - I just have one question for you can you honestly tell me that the advice you gave Marco was based on his best interests and not on your own?
  - Well, that's an interesting question, Niles. And I'll tell you something. I don't care. I'm in love, and I don't care. Catherine is mine now. I'm in, and Marco's out. 
- - You're insane.
  - Perhaps. But you just ran a stop sign. <i>Niles slams on the brakes</i> Now we're in the middle of the intersection. <i>car horns blare, Niles drives on</i> I'll tell you, Niles, I, ah... I haven't Felt this way in ages. There's an excitement about this. I, I feel tingly. 
- - What's your stomach have to say about this?
  - My stomach? 
- - I definitely know what I'm talking about. Ever since you were a child, if you even approached a breach of ethics you'd get queasy. Actually, you'd get physically sick.
  - Well, at least when it came to ethics I didn't get spontaneous nosebleeds. 
- - Remember the time we lifted that dollar bill from mom's change purse? We left quite a gruesome trail back to the tree house that day.
  - Ah, but you see, Niles, you've proved my point. I'm not the least bit queasy, I'm fine. My head, my heart, my gastrointestinal system, they're all shouting the same thing - It's okay! <i>looks around</i> Niles? Niles, this is a new car?

  - Well, maybe you should try my "salmon-chanted evening."

  - It's, it's not you. Ah, it's, it's me. Every time I come close to breaching my ethics, I-I end up getting sick.
- - What are you talking about? 
  - Marco called into the show today and... he said he was thinking of getting back with you and I told him not to. 
- - So? 
  - Well, I just have a feeling that... maybe I told him that not because it was good for him, but because it was good for me.
- - Oh, Frasier, who cares? <i>kisses him<i> 
  - Well, I do. I care. You know? Look, any psychiatrist worth his salt would care. That's why we don't get involved with our patients. Or their girlfriends.
- - Are you, are you saying you want to break up with me? 
  - No, I don't want to. I have to. If I don't, I'll throw up all over your shoes.

  - Dad, Daphne, a situation has arisen over at work and uh, I'm not sure how it should be handled. I was hoping maybe your objective viewpoint could uh, be helpful. 
- - Sure, shoot.
  - Well, what would you think if I did a commercial and publicly endorsed a product? 
- - Oh, you mean like Cher does?
  - Thank you Daphne, one against. Dad? 
- - What's the product?
  - Well, the station wanted me to do a commercial for a Chinese restaurant. 
- - Well, what's the problem?
  - Well, I hold a position of trust in this community, and people do what I tell them to, and I would hate to be accused of abusing that position. The thought of a doctor selling things is kind of distasteful, don't you think? 
- - What about Dr. Sneezy's cold medicine?
  - Dr. Sneezy is a cartoon character. The fact that he's a giant purple hippopotamus should have probably tipped you off. 
- - I say take the money and run.
  - Well, you know, I'm tempted, if for no other reason than to keep Bulldog from further alienating the Asian-American community. I just want to make sure I don't compromise my principles. 
- - Dr. Crane, you've dedicated your live to helping people, haven't you?
  - Well, yes. 
- - Yeah. By the way, "yen" is Japanese, not Chinese.
  - Well... Did I tell you, I got a call from the owners of the Hunan Palace the other day, they said that since I started doing these commercials their business had gone up by 30 percent. 
- - Well, isn't that what advertising is supposed to do?
  - Yes it is, Miss Sour-Britches, give me a little credit. My God, I've pleased the boys upstairs, I've gotten perfect strangers to try a new restaurant, and most importantly, I've helped a struggling immigrant family who came to these shores a mere twelve years ago, with nothing more than a dream, a few recipes, and a wok.<i>Frasier exits into corridor to find a woman (Bebe) waiting for him.</i> 
- - Dr. Crane? What a privilege this is.
  - Excuse me? 
- - Bebe Glaser. I'm Bulldog Briscoe's agent.
  - Ah. Ah, well. Pleasure meeting you. 
- - Listen. I'm not usually this forward, but I'm going to come right out and say it. I've done some research and I know you're not represented by anyone, how would you feel about signing on with me as a client? If your answer is no, it won't hurt my feelings.
  - Well, I really don't think so. 
- - <i>sorrowfully<i> Why?
  - It's not that I'm not flattered, Miss Glaser, but umm... you see, I'm not really a radio personality per se. 
- - Oh come on, Dr. Crane, I've heard those spots you've done for that Chinese restaurant, you make me want to stuff my face full of egg rolls and... I don't know what.
  - Thank you. Uh... but I, you see, I dine at the Hunan Palace frequently, and uh, that's the only reason I did those commercials. 
- - The last thing I would ever want you to do is to advertise something you don't believe in. I am an agent, not a pimp.
  - Well, I don't mean to offend... 
- - Are you kidding? You're terrific, you can't offend me. Let me just leave you with my card.
  - Well, I really don't think that's necessary. 
- - <i>snatches card back<i> Give me back my card. I will not let you call me. It is too refreshing to meet someone who isn't seduced by the almighty dollar.

- - <i>returns<i> Tuition, innocent. Oh wait, I see. You're going to send him to a state college.
  - Well no, no. I plan to send him to my alma mater, Harvard.

  - Well, you know, maybe we should talk, sometime. 
- - Let's talk now. <i>comes back<i> I think I can die peacefully without seeing the first half of the Stanford-Cal game. <i>they walk off arm in arm<i>
  - You see, it's not that I object to doing commercials, it's just that I would have to try a product first before I could endorse it. 
- - Tell me again why I'm here?
  - Because if I do the commercial I have to say that my friends and family enjoy this, and I won't say it unless it's true. 
- - I feel kind of silly sitting here in the showroom.
  - Well I apologize for that, but it's the best place to try one. So, tell me the truth. Aren't you two enjoying this? 
- - Well, I do like the bubbles. It's a little like sitting in hot champagne. Not that I've done that very much.
  - Dad, did you know that this unit is made from the same heat resistant space-age polymer that's used on the NASA space shuttles? 
- - Great. Next time I'm re-entering the earth's atmosphere in a hot tub I won't have to worry.
  - Well? Do you like it? 
- - ...I have to admit, it's making my hip feel a little better.
  - That's all I needed to hear. My friends like it, my family likes it - I like it. I can do the commercial and Frederick can go to Harvard. <i>a man walks into the showroom</i> Oh my god! Isn't that Dave Hendler from our building? You know, he's the head of the Seattle Psychiatric Association. <i>He takes a big breath and ducks under the water</i>

  - Really? 
- - Yeah. I liked it.
  - You really, really like it? 
- - No, I liked it.
  - Well, what was wrong with it? 
- - Nothing.
  - You hated it, didn't you? 
- - Hello, darling. <i>enters<i>
  - Bebe. 
- - First off, <i>mea culpa<i> for dropping by unannounced, but you are going to kiss me when you hear what I've done for you. <i>She notices Daphne and jumps to the wrong conclusion.<i> 
  - Oh... hello. 
- - Hi.
  - Oh, no no no no no. Bebe, this is Daphne Moon, my father's physical therapist. <i>Bebe laughs, as if to say "the very idea."</i> Well, I believe I was about to kiss you for something. 
- - Well, today I got a very attractive offer for you to be a product spokesman, and we know they're serious because it's pay or play.
  - Ooh... <i><i>he says to cover his bafflement</i></i> 
- - Well, listen to this one.
  - How do you know that? 
- - Well, I must confess, there is a chapter of my life I haven't told you or your father about. Back when I was twelve, I starred in a television show in England. Well, I'll leave you to your business. <i>makes to escape<i>
  - Daphne, Daphne, just get back here. You what? 
- - I starred in a TV series. It was quite popular in its day, maybe you've heard of it? "Mind Your Knickers"? It was about a group of high-spirited, ethnically diverse twelve-year-olds in a girls' private boarding school. I played Emma, the short, spunky one. Of course, by the end of the series, I was sixteen, five foot ten, and they had me boozies bound up tighter than a mummy. Well, I'm off. <i>leaves<i>
  - The woman is like an artichoke. You just peel away one astounding leaf after another. Well anyway, back to business. What have you got for me? 
- - <i>producing tin of nuts<i> Voila. Emery's Nuts.
  - Oh, dear. Oh, I can't endorse these. 
- - Why not?
  - Well, for one thing I don't like them, and they're sixty percent fat, they're laced with salt and they wreak havoc with my diverticulitis. 
- - Of course they do, they're nuts.
  - I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't. 
- - Well... then I will just tell them they can take their five figure deal and find someone else.
  - Five figures? 
- - Didn't I mention, precious? This is for television, the big kahuna.
  - Television? 
- - Well, I understand if you have a problem.
  - Well I-I... I don't mean to be difficult, I do have my standards, you know? I only endorse things that I like or... or I think are therapeutic, like the hot-tub. 
- - Let me pinch you, you're not real! 
  - Well... 
- - Oh, what's wrong? It's a scream.
  - Yes, but it... it may be a scream, but it, it's... what's the word I'm looking for? 
- - Finally, a script. Thanks, Jeff. <i>hands it to Frasier<i> Seen it already, you're going to love it.
  - <i>reading</i> "Two nuts are arguing with each other." That's cute. "�I'm a nut.' �No, I'm a nut!'" Ha, that's funny. Ah... "�Hold it, you're both nuts. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, noted psychiatrist, and I know a nut when I see one.'" Hmm, I just, I don't know abut that line. 
- - What? "Tuition?!" "Retirement beach house?!" <i>calms down<i> I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, it's just that I want so much for you.
  - Bebe, I don't want to get a reputation for being difficult, but I... I'm just not comfortable with this line. 
- - Frasier? Frasier, Frasier. How long have we been together?
  - Six days. 
- - Do you think I would ever have you do something that you were uncomfortable with? What makes this so wonderful is that you're spoofing yourself, you're showing that psychiatrists can be loose, you're making shrinks more accessible to the average person.
  - So what you're saying is that I would be doing psychiatry a service by doing this commercial? 
- - You have a way of cutting through the baloney that knocks me out cold.
  - <i>reading</i> Oh, dear. What does this mean? "Frasier comes out of his shell."<i>Bebe notices two stagehands pulling on set a giant monkey nut,and swivels Frasier's chair round so he can't see it, B.S.-ingas she does so.</i> 
- - Why do you feel like that?
  - Well, for one thing my co-stars are dressed up as an almond and a walnut. Now listen Niles, I've... I need your guidance. 
- - It is a... technical term. It's a light... a lighting thing. You, you see, you come out of your shadow, or your shell, into the light.
  - <i>in awe</i> I have so much to learn about this business.<i>FADE TO</i>
- - Why do you have that ridiculous tissue around your neck?
  - Well, they didn't tell me I could take it off, so I kept it on. 
- - Oh, silly me. Here I thought it was just a means to attract attention, to have people come up to you and say, "Are you an actor?" thus affording you the opportunity to say yes, you are indeed an actor, and then proceed to crow, gloat and strut in a way you could not otherwise do.
  - And the reason you have "SHRINK" on your license plate would be...? Niles, listen. I've got to do this commercial in half an hour and... I just don't think I can go through with it, I'm afraid that I'm compromising my integrity as a psychiatrist. 
- - Oh, certainly not. You sold out a long time ago. You know, the moment you agreed to do that call-in show, you sold out.
  - Oh, Niles. You are such a purist. Granted, I can't do the kind of in-depth analysis one can with a single patient, but my show helps literally thousands of people a day. 
- - Let's face it, Frasier, you talk about wanting to safeguard your professional dignity, but the first time you went on the air, you got out of medicine and into showbiz. You're no different from that movie star who let everybody look up her skirt in that film, and then did nothing but complain that nobody took her seriously as an actress.
  - Well, that has nothing to do with this! 
- - Have you seen that movie? Maris and I rented the video and, I don't mind telling you, we pushed our beds together that night! <i>pause<i> And that was no mean feat. Her room, as you know, is across the hall.
  - Niles, will you just tell me, would you do it? 
- - A nude scene? I suppose if it were integral to the plot...
  - Not a nude scene! Would you do this commercial? 
- - Frasier, I don't see this as a problem.
  - You don't think this is the selling out of Frasier Crane? 
- - Oh, certainly not, I'm a respected psychiatrist. <i>looks at watch, then stands<i> 
  - So what you're saying is that I shouldn't do it. 
- - What are you still doing up? <i>sees Frasier rewinding the video<i> Oh geez, you're not watching the tape of that dumb commercial again!
  - I can't get it off my mind. Did I do the right thing? 
- - Of course you did. Freddie's gonna thank you for it.
  - Here, watch it with me one more time.<i>He starts the video. The commercial consists of two nuts arguinguntil the monkey nut opens up, revealing... Dr. Joyce Brothers.</i> 
- - Stop! You're both nuts! I'm noted psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers and I'm here to tell you that I'm just crazy about Emery's Nuts. So if you're crazy about nuts too, pick up a can of Emery's today. Emery's - the nut lover's nut.
  - <i>switching off video</i> I suppose you're right, dad. Freddie will thank me. Dr. Joyce is his favorite psychologist. 
- - You know, Dr. Joyce is pretty good. I remember her from "Hollywood Squares." She was always under Charlie Weaver. <i>As they head for bed<i>
  - No, no. Charlie Weaver was always on the bottom. 
- - No, I don't think so. Let's see, Paul Lynn was in the middle, George Goldblum was under him, and... where was Wally Cox?
  - Wally Cox. Uh, upper left, next to Rosemarie Dubarr. 
- - So I just had to get out of the house. Maris's Junior League are rehearsing their spring musical - this year they're doing "Cats." The past week and a half I've been watching two dozen underweight, tightly-pulled woman in leotards crawling round the music room, meowing. I'm telling you Frasier, my allergies are acting up. 
  - Oh Niles, I think you're exaggerating. 
- - No. No, really. You've no idea how vivid the experience is. As God is my judge, I swear, Mrs. Presley-Bismouth was scent- marking the divan.
  - God, you'd think women of that age would choose more suitable material. Remember the last show they did, "The Sound Of Music"? My God, half the Von Trapp children were having hot flashes.<i>Roz enters with "Chopper" Dave and Teddy, a technician.</i> 
- - Let me guess. The wacky gang from the office?
  - <i>making introductions</i> Everyone, this is my brother Niles. This is Teddy, one of our brilliant engineers.. 
- - Teddy, my man!
  - This is KACL's inimitable "Chopper" Dave. Your Eye in the Sky for traffic. 
- - This has been kind of fun, ah, but I really have to go. I'm conducting a seminar on multiple personality disorders, and it takes me forever to fill out the name tags. <i>leaves<i>
  - Well, KACL team, what is on the agenda for today? 
- - Sit down and listen to this. I got a juicy piece of news, and it's reliable. Alan in Accounting got it from Steven in Promotions, who got it from Cindy in Retail Sales, who got it from Arlene, the station manager's secretary - that the station is definitely way over budget, and somebody's getting the ax. But don't tell anybody, I was sworn to secrecy.
  - Roz, I'm ashamed of you! Gossip, gossip, gossip. Don't you know how destructive that can be? It does nothing but sully good people's names and create an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. 
- - Oh, lighten up. Gossip is the lifeblood of the corporate world. If it wasn't for gossip, we wouldn't know any of the important things, like how much everybody makes.
  - You know my salary? 
- - Could be.
  - Oh, no no no no. He's the station's highest-rated personality. I mean, with the exception of women thirty-five to fifty-four who happen to think that I'm... sort of a god. 
- - Hey. Have you heard about my new gimmick for the show? If the Seahawks beat Buffalo this Sunday, I promise to do my entire show hanging by my feet.
  - You can do that?
- -  Ooh...
  - Oh people, people. You're jumping to conclusions. Show a little respect. Bulldog has devoted fifteen years of his life to radio. My own personal feelings aside, the man deserves better than to become the object of some scurrilous rumor that as yet hasn't a shred of truth to it. 
- - Yeah. I suppose you're right.
  - Yes, well... just in case, I've got dibs on his parking space. <i>leaves</i><i>FADE OUT</i>
- - Dr. Crane, we have Don on his car phone. He's having a problem with his weight. 
  - Don, it's a common problem. I'm listening. 
- - <i>v.o.<i> Ah, it's the screwiest thing, Doc. I eat healthy, I work out. But no matter what I do, I can't lose a pound, it's very depressing. 
  - Yes, well, losing weight can be a lifelong struggle. It takes a commitment. Now, if you're ready to accept that, there are a number of things I can suggest...
- - <i>v.o., in background<i> May I take your order, please? 
  - Uh Don, what was that? 
- - Ah &mdash; oh, nothing. It was the radio. Go ahead, you were talking. 
  - Don...? Where are you? 
- - <i>v.o.<i> Hey, speak into the clown's mouth! 
  - Don...? 
- - Sorry, Dr. Crane. <i>imitates static<i> I'm going to lose you. I'm going into a tunnel. Goodbye! <i>hangs up<i>

- - Hey Frasier, I've got to run up to payroll, be back in five.
  - Okay. <i>He steps into the corridor, where he meets Father Mike at the candy machine.</i>
- - Oh, hello Frasier.
  - How you doing? 
- - Say, I just heard a rumor that somebody 'round here is being let go. Do you know anything about that, because to tell you the truth, I'm afraid it might be me.
  - Oh Father, Father. You should better than to put any stock in idle office gossip. 
- - I know, I know. But it's hard not to. My numbers have been down lately, they keep changing my timeslot. I'm really bummed!
  - Well, listen Father. I don't like to engage in gossip, but you have nothing to worry about. 
- - Yes? Why?
  - Well, someone is being let go... 
- - Oh?
  - But ah, it's not you. It's Bulldog. 
- - Bulldog? Oh, what a shame.
  - Yes. 
- - Has anybody spoken for his parking space?
  - Well I have, yes.<i>Frasier goes back into the booth to find that Bulldog has beenstanding behind the door, and has heard every word.</i>
- - So I'm a goner, huh?
  - Bulldog. Well, how long have you been...?
- - Long enough to know I'm the one who's out. <i>starts banging head on table<i> I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! Damn it! Now I know why Ned Miller wants to see me after work. It's to can my butt. I mean, why else would he be willing to miss happy hour at El Paquito's? The man's a total boozer!
  - Now, now now now now, Bulldog listen, this is just a rumor. You know how out of the loop I am. 
- - Oh, yeah. And after all I've done for this lousy station, this is how they repay me? Well, that's it! Nobody fires Bob Briscoe! I'll quit first.
  - Now, now now. Don't do anything rash. Now listen, I suggest you try to vent your anger first. <i>Bulldog grabs the mike and rips it in two.</i>
- - Oh! <i>to Frasier<i> What was that?
  - Bulldog's quitting. 
- - Why?
  - Well, because Ned Miller is firing him. 
- - Who told you that?
  - You did. 
- - That was just a rumor... You didn't tell him that, did you?!
  - I didn't mean to, he overheard me. 
- - Oh, God!
  - What? Come on, you guys were so positive - the expense account thing, the meeting with management at five? 
- - That meeting was to discuss taking his show national! Don't you know anything that goes on around here?!
  - Apparently not! 
- - Well, don't just stand there. Go call his secretary, she'll stop him before he gets in.
  - I don't believe this, this is incredible, <i>on phone</i> Yes, hello, hello Arlene? Arlene, yes, listen. Bob Briscoe's about to jump into the office and... oh. <i>replaces phone</i> God, he's already burst into the office with Miller. Oh god, this is a disaster. 
- - Maybe not, maybe not. Maybe before Bulldog starts anything Miller will tell him what the meeting was really about.
  - Well I, I suppose you're right. For all we know they may be having a good laugh about this right now.<i>Cut to station manager's point of view (shown through a fish-eyecamera lens). Bulldog is in his face, telling him off. But instead of words, we hear dog-like barking and snarling.Cut back to the booth.</i> 
- - I did it! I scorched him! <i>laughs maniacally<i> You should have seen the look on his face. Oh, I even told him about the time his wife came on to me at the Christmas party. I said there wasn't enough liquor in the world to make me sleep with that porker!
  - You said that to Ned Miller?
- - Yes! Yeah, he even took a swing at me. I gave him a little okey-doke and he hit air!
  - My god, the man tried to strike you? Listen, Bulldog...
- - Hey, hey! No sudden moves, doc. I'm still too pumped. I feel like poppin' someone. <i>he leaves<i>
  - My god, my god, this is unbelievable. <i>to Roz</i> A man has quit his job just because of a rumor that you spread! 
- - Me?! The whole point of gossip is to talk behind the person's back, not in front of him. I didn't realize you were unclear on this concept!
  - I'm a bad, bad man. <i>hangs head in shame</i> 
- - Well Frasier, you have got to do something. You gotta call Ned Miller and get this whole thing cleared up.
  - Oh, right. "Call Ned Miller, clear this thing up." The man is totally unstable, he tried to take a swing at me the day he hired me.<i>Chopper Dave comes in, shouting as usual.</i> 
- - OOH, JUST HEARD A HOT RUMOUR! BULLDOG QUIT!
  - No kidding. 
- - Nothing. Just loved it.<i>Frasier enters.<i>
  - God. Can you believe this weather? 
- - Oh, Frasier. I'm glad you're home. What happened to Bulldog?
  - <i>panic-stricken</i> Who told you? 
- - Nobody told me anything. I turned into the "Gonzo Sports Show" today like I always do, and they had Father Mike filling in. I hate that. All it was, was "Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Notre Dame."
  - Yes, well, Bulldog tended his resignation. 
- - Oh, no. Why would he do that? He's the top sports guy in town.
  - Well, you know, things just go funny sometimes. It's a tough business, this radio game, you know? 
- - Dr. Crane, I'm picking up something from you. You're shrouded in an aura of guilt.
  - ...Maybe I am. 
- - Frasier?
  - All right, all right. Ah, there was a rumor going �round the station that Bulldog was going to get sacked, and then... I was repeating it to someone and he overheard me and flew off the handle, went up and quit his job. In the end it turned out that the rumor wasn't true. <i>to Daphne</i> Of course, you already knew that, didn't you?<i>Niles's phone rings.</i> 
- - Now listen here, Frasier. If you're responsible for Bulldog losing his job, you've got to make this right. You gotta go down to that station and talk to the boss and get him his job back.
  - Well, that's a little easier said than done. Ned Miller is the most intimidating, heartless, mean-spirited man I've ever had the misfortune to meet. 
- - So you're selling Bulldog down the river just 'cause you don't have the guts to go and face this guy?
  - No, no. For all we know this might just be the best thing that ever happened to him. You know, he's always talking about how he should be in a larger market, like Los Angeles, or New York...<i>Eddie starts pawing at the front door. </i>
- - Hiya, Doc.
  - Well, what are you doing, just standing there?
- - ...I don't know. I was trying to decide whether or not I should bother you. See, my life is kinda over, but you got company, so I'll go.
  - No, no-no-no-no. Come in, come in, it's just family. This is my dad, and Daphne Moon. 
- - You haven't heard the half of it. <i>grabs Frasier's sherry and throws it back<i> My girlfriend threw me out. She said the only reason she was with me was because I was on the radio. Can you believe that? Eight years we've been together. I loved that woman. Even when I was tomcatting around, I loved that woman.

- - Wow. You'd do that for me?
  - Why sure, what's the point of having an expensive suede couch if you can't have a bunch of people crashing on it?
- - Thanks, Doc. Hey, I hope it's okay, but I could really use a hot shower.
  - Oh sure, sure. 
- - Down the hall, second door on the left. Towels are in the cabinet.<i>Bulldog exits down the corridor. Martin and Daphne go back to staring at Frasier.<i>
  - Now, you two just leave me alone. This is not my fault. Look, I am not responsible for Bulldog going up there and popping off to the boss. You can stare at me 'til you're blue in the face, I'm not going to go see Ned Miller. <i>Eddie joins in the staring. Frasier knows he's beat.</i> 
- - What, what?!
  - <i>entering</i> Mr. Miller... 
- - Oh, it's you, Crane.
  - Look, I don't mean to disturb you, but Arlene wasn't at her desk. 
- - I had to let her go. A lot of stuff she's been doing lately's been ticking me off.
  - If this is a bad time... 
- - No, it's a perfect time, I need you to hold this. <i>indicating picture<i> Come on. Now!<i>Frasier takes the painting and holds it to the wall as Miller stands back.<i>
  - Okay, how's this? 
- - Ah, put it down.<i>Frasier lowers the painting to reveal a large hole in the wall.<i>
  - Oh my lord! What happened here? 
- - Oh, that psycho Bulldog and I got into it this afternoon. He threw my Golden Mike at me!
  - <i>looking at hole</i> And he did that with your little trophy? 
- - No, he just chipped the paint with the trophy, I did that with his head!<i>He goes to the bar and pours himself a scotch from a decanter.<i>
  - Ah. That's, ah, sort of why I'm here. 
- - Drink?
  - No. No thank you, Mr. Miller. Um, I know that Bulldog was up here, and he said some... pretty regrettable things to you. 
- - I'll say he said some things. You want to hear them? I tape everything in this office.<i>This makes Frasier even more uncomfortable.<i>
  - Well anyway, ah, a lot of what he said was, ah... was my fault, you see? Well, you see, I heard a rumor that, ah, management was thinking about lightening the load a bit. Well, I heard it was Bulldog that was gonna get sacked and I... I was repeating the rumor to someone and Bulldog heard me. And that's why he came up here and started telling you... 
- - That I'm a drunk, that I'm incompetent at my job, that my wife is a big fat slut!
  - That is indefensible! Your wife is not overweight! <i>realizes</i> Well anyway, my point is that, um, I'd like you to reconsider giving Bulldog his job back. And ah, whatever the consequences to me, I'm willing to accept it. 
- - Look, I won't kid you. Bulldog meant big numbers to us in Drive Time, we need him back. Tell you what - you get him to apologize to me... oh hell, why don't I just say it? If he'll kiss my ass, maybe we can work something out.
  - Oh sir, sir, I'm sure that'll make him so happy. <i>He stands and holds out his hand, but Miller has already picked up his glass again.</i>
- - Actually Crane, that uh, rumor about someone being let go is, uh... true.
  - What? 
- - Now that you've so nobly gotten Bulldog his job back, the station still needs to make some cutbacks on those high-priced salaries.
  - Oh god, not Father Mike? Oh, no. 
- - No. It's not Father Mike.
  - Chopper Dave? Ray the Greengrocer? Bonnie "the Auto Lady" Weems?<i>Ned looks at Frasier, indicating it's him.</i> 
- - Oh, you could say that. I've just been fired. They decided the best way to cut the budget was to get rid of MY high salary.
  - <i>struggles to hide his grin</i> Oh, Ned, I... I'm so sorry. Then I guess this means that my job is still safe, then? 
- - Look, Crane. You're new to the radio game, I've been around a long time. People get fired. But they always get back on their feet. So... I bet you I could get you that drink now?
  - Yes, I bet you could. 
- - Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. Not a morning person, are we? Well, never you mind. I am. Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock. I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional. Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force. I can understand why you'd want him to live here, although not many sons would do that, not without getting paid for it. Anyway, coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop. They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they?
  - <i>still groggy</i> And you are...? 
- - Excuse me. <i>fills his glass<i>
  - Bad news? 
- - Yeah. I guess so.
  - <i>expansively</i> Well, you know Ned... I haven't been in the radio game that long. But, uh, I've been around long enough to know that people get fired. And when they do, they always seem to land on their feet. Now I've known quite a few people - and counseled them - that have suffered similar setbacks. But, ah, in time you will embrace this. Learn to think of this as, oh, a new chapter. You know, in theatrical circles, they always say "Every exit is but an entrance to somewhere else."<i>Miller stares at Frasier for a long beat.</i> 
- - Daphne. Daphne Moon. I moved in yesterday. You hired me to take care of your father.
  - <i>realizing</i> Of course. Forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered. 
- - Oh, yes. I completely understand about one's morning ablutions. I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth... 
  - <i>interrupting</i> Miss Moon! For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis? Thank you. <i>goes into kitchen</i> Now, my coffee. 
- - <i>doing a fry-up<i> The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed. 
  - <i>pouring his coffee</i> Good morning to you too, dad. 
- - Morning was two hours ago. And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now.<i>Frasier adjusts his robe, then tastes his coffee. He is not amused.<i>
  - Hey, this isn't my coffee. Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks? 
- - That's it. Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it.
  - <i>pouring it down the sink</i> Didn't that just dress it up? 
- - I like it. Gives it a zing. Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready. <i>He leaves the kitchen with a plate full of fried food.<i>
  - <i>following</i> Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt. 
- - Ah, girlie food. Besides, I already fixed your breakfast. Now, I made you &ldquo;Eggs in a Nest.&rdquo;
  - Ah yes, the Crane family specialty. Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread. I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak. 
- - Yoo-hoo? It's right here, we brought it in for you.
  - <i>to outside world</i> Sorry, sorry. <i>closes door and examines paper</i> Oh, wait a minute, this... where's the rubber band? This paper has been read. 
- - You want cheese on that?
  - No. I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain. <i>to himself</i> Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast, <i>sees Martin&rsquo;s chair</i> Oh god, it wasn't a dream. I'll get him for this. <i>to Eddie</i> And his little dog, too. <i>opens front door</i> Where's my paper? Who's stolen my paper? Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you! 
- - Well don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it.
  - That is not the point. Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you? 
- - You're going to give a speech, aren't you?
  - Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic. 
- - Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on.
  - Let us get something clear. I am not a morning person. I have to ease into my day slowly. First I have my coffee - sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage. Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast. Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper. If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function. My radio show suffers, and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advise, to help them through their troubled lives. I'm sorry if this may sound priggish, but I have grown comfortable with this part of myself. It is the magic that is me. 
- - I know this is a stressful time, and this is new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly. <i>looks down at Frasier's robe<i> Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see.<i>Frasier closes his robe. He sits at the table and starts readingthe paper. Eddie comes over and jumps onto a chair to stare at him.<i>
  - Down Eddie, down. <i>Eddie doesn't move</i> I said down. Good boy Eddie, just get down. Good good, Eddie get down. Eddie, GET DOWN! <i>Eddie still just sits there, staring at Frasier</i> Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me. 
- - Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning. Just ignore him.
  - I'm trying to. 
- - Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two.
  - Hello Leonard, I'm listening.
- - <i>v.o.<i> Oh, hi Dr. Crane. Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah... well, here goes. Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces. Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat, I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home.
  - Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion?
- - Nothing. Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all. I haven't seen another person in eight months.
  - Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia. But you're not alone.
- - But I am alone, Dr. Crane.
  - Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining, so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist. Well, that's all the time we have for today. You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Stay tuned for the news. Then next up, Bob &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show. I never miss it. <i>off air</i> Yeah, right. 
- - You want your messages?
  - Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while. Today more than most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude. I've got a fascinating book here, a comfortable chair and a soundproof booth. <i>Just as Frasier leans back and opens his book the door opensand Bulldog walks in pushing his props trolley.</i>
- - Hiya, doc. How're they hangin'?
  - Bulldog, what are you doing here?
- - Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape! THIS STINKS! THIS IS TOTAL B.S.! THIS... oh, here it is.
  - <i>preparing to leave</i> Let me just get out of your way.
- - Oh, by the way doc, doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents? You know what I would have told him? Sports. You go out there, break some heads- <i>hits himself on the head to illustrate<i> That'll turn him around.
  - Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet. <i>goes into Roz's booth</i>
- - <i>to Frasier, as he starts to exit into the corridor<i> Hold on a second, I have to ask you something. <i>into phone<i> Gary? I broke up with him three weeks ago. The sex was okay, but he was kinda limited. <i>Frasier moves to leave, Roz stops him<i> No, no. <i>into phone<i> It wasn't that Gary was bad in bed. I mean, he knew where all the parts were. Unfortunately, most of them were his. Yes, totally passionless, it was like he was thinking of someone else. I know I was. Somebody's here, I gotta go. Alright? Talk to you later. Bye, mom. <i>hangs up<i>
  - That was your mother? 
- - Yeah, why?
  - You talk to your mother like that? 
- - Well, we're both adults. We talk about everything.
  - Well, isn't that healthy. 
- - What, you don't talk to your dad like that?
  - Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all. 
- - Really?
  - Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really similar people. In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother. You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep.
- - <i>into mike<i> Yes, he called, he'll be right here. <i>to Frasier<i> So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks?
  - Maybe some other time. Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude. I'll go somewhere where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me. I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park. <i>exits</i><i>FADE TO </i>
- - <i>to Martin<i>...so the elephant says, &ldquo;He's with me.&rdquo; <i>they both laugh<i> Oh, Dr. Crane, you're home. We just got back from your father's physical therapy.
  - Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day. Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you, it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting chapter. 
- - Ooh, I understand. So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea?
  - No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you. 
- - <i>sitting in the Chair<i> Whatcha reading?
  - Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting. 
- - I might. Any good?
  - Well, I haven't formed a opinion yet. Oddly enough, I'm having a little trouble getting into it. 
- - <i>after a moment's silence, indicates book<i> Thick.
  - Dad will you... Listen, I don't want to offend, but if you wouldn't mind, could you just leave me alone, let me read my book? 
- - No problem.<i>Martin sits quietly, not looking as Frasier reads. This finallyirks Frasier.<i>
  - What are you doing? 
- - I'm leaving you alone.
  - Well, it's very annoying! 
- - Ah, what's your problem? You've been sucking a lemon all week.
  - All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is, I can't get a moment&rsquo;s peace alone in my own house. 
- - Well, forgive me. When you invited me to move in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room <i>starts to leave<i>
  - <i>quietly</i> Perhaps only evenings. 
- - I heard that!
  - Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot! 
- - Ah, you know, you've always been like this. You were always a fussy little kid, and it's gotten worse ever since. You and your precious morning routine. You gotta have your coffee, you gotta have your quiet, you gotta have this, you gotta have that. Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid.
  - Hey, hey-hey-hey! I don't have to sit here and listen to that! 
- - Ah, if you want everything so perfect, why don't you go live in a bubble?
  - Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting! <i>He storms out the front door and slams it behind him.</i> 
- - Hello there, Frasier.
  - Oh, what fresh hell is this? 
- - That's a nice way to greet your brother. <i>to waiter<i> Caf&eacute; latte, <em>per piachere.<em>
  - I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I've been trying to read this book and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted. 
- - Oh, &ldquo;The Holotropic Mind&rdquo; by Stanislav Grolf. I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness.
  - Great. <i>slams book shut</i> Now you've ruined the ending! 
- - I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate. <i>the waiter brings his coffee<i> <em>Mille Grazie.<em> <i>to Frasier<i> So, how's father?
  - Father? You mean the man who's driving me crazy? The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep? The man who just drove me out of my own home? 
- - And how's work?
  - Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dad and I had another fight. I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is. 
- - Well, what are the alternatives?
  - Well, if I didn't feel so guilty I'd, I'd do what I should have done in the first place just move dad and Daphne into their own apartment. 
- - Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier. It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance. And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place.
  - Refresh me. 
- - You wanted to get closer to dad.
  - I still do. There isn't anything I'd like more, but he makes it impossible. I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee, I can't have any peace in my own home. 
- - So what you&rsquo;re saying is, you want to be closer to dad, but you don't actually want him around. Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him - I mean, really talk to him?
  - Well, I... <i>he thinks about it</i> Maybe I haven't done my best. I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I? Well ah, thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother, and a credit to the psychiatric profession. 
- - <i>entering from back, carrying a box<i> We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement. There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in. We discussed it last night, remember?
  - Of course, of course. 
- - I was just on my way to ask that peculiar little man from building services to give me a hand moving them.
  - Oh yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards. 
- - Remind me again - which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?
  - The brown one.<i>Daphne exits via the front door. Martin enters from the bedroom.</i> 
- - Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry.
  - Well thanks, but I'm not. Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier. 
- - Ah, forget about it. I already have.
  - You know, I guess there's no secret that there's been a lot of tension between us, and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk. And I... I thought we might have a conversation. 
- - Right now?
  - Yes, I think now would be a good time. 
- - Later would be better.
  - It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation, I'm talking about three minutes of your life. 
- - Well, I hope it is only three minutes, 'cause my program's coming on.
  - Well, alright. If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes. <i>He does so, and they sit at the table.</i> 
- - So what do you want to talk about?
  - Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation like two normal people without getting on each other&rsquo;s nerves. Ready? <i>sets timer</i> Go. 
- - This is stupid.
  - <i>stops timer</i> One second? That's our personal best? Let us see if we can beat it. <i>sets timer</i> Ready? Go. 
- - So how about those Seahawks?
  - <i>stops timer</i> No sports. 
- - All right. But no opera.
  - Agreed. <i>sets timer</i> Ready? Go. 
- - <i>pause<i> This is your idea, you say something first.
  - Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself that ah, that you don't know. Ah, six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks, ah, there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. I... And then I thought of Frederick. 
- - And you didn't jump, huh?
  - Good, dad. 
- - Wow. I never knew that.
  - Well, that's the point of this whole experiment. To tell one another something that we don't know about each other. Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn. 
- - Okay. <i>thinks<i> Well, about two months ago, I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me... and all of a sudden something flew up in my eye. And, when I was trying to get it out, I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp.
  - That's it? You call that vulnerable? 
- - It hurt.
  - Oh well... I'm not talking about that kind of pain, I'm talking about your emotions, your soul. Some sort of painful, gut- wrenching experience. 
- - Other than this one?
  - Oh, God! Always the flip answer. 
- - Well, this whole thing's stupid.
  - Well, not to me. Oh, how should I expect anything out of you? You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant, stubborn, cold man I've ever known! 
- - You said &ldquo;cold&rdquo; twice, Mr. Egghead.
  - Egghead? Egghead? 
- - You said &ldquo;egghead&rdquo; twice, too.
  - Oh, you are so infuriating! 
- - Well, you're no day at the beach either. You know what you are? <i>the timer bings<i> I'll tell you later, it's time for my program. <i>moves towards Chair<i>
  - Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is. 
- - Oh, will you give it a rest? 
  - We're not getting along, and it's not getting any better. I'm not sure how to say this, but ah... I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... 
- - I know what you're trying to say. &ldquo;You want what's best for both of us.&rdquo; You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space, and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering.
  - Well, yes. I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all. 
- - Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship, to make some connection. Well, that kind of thing takes a couple of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it? You're the shrink.
  - Couple of years, huh? 
- - Except for one thing. I'm not going.
  - What? 
- - Ah, it'll go by before you know it.
  - Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. 
- - I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.
  - Okay. 
- - Great. How about you and me having a beer together?
  - Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that. I'd love to have a beer with you, dad. 
- - Well then, you better haul ass, 'cause the store closes in ten minutes.
  - Right. <i>exits</i><i>End of Act Two.</i>
- - Do you mind if we stop while I tell you my pet peeve?
  - Not at all. 
- - <i>v.o<i> Look, it's about my mother. She's getting on now and she doesn't have much of a life. And she doesn't want to do anything or go anywhere and she literally hangs around the house all day. I mean, it's very frustrating...
  - I'm sorry Doug, can we just go back a second? You said your mother literally hangs around the house. Well, I suppose it's a pet peeve of mine but I suppose what you mean is that she figuratively "hangs around" the house. To literally hang around the house you'd have to be a bat or spider monkey. Now, back to your problem? 
- - <i>angry<i> I hate it when intellectual pinheads with superiority complexes nit-pick your grammar when they come to you for help. That's what I got a problem with! <i>hangs up<i>
  - <i>happily</i> I think what he means is, that is a thing with which he has a problem. Now it's time for a station break and we'll be right back after a word from our friends at <i>reads</i> "Pizza, Pizza, Pizza." <i>He puts on the commercial. Roz enters.</i> 
- - Hey, do you want to know my pet peeve? It's when you're in a department store and the clerk is right in the middle of helping you and the phone rings. So he starts taking care of them. And you're left standing there going, "Excuse me, but all I did was come all the way down here in person, whilst some joker is sitting at home in his underwear getting first rate service!" Don't you hate that?
  - Actually, I do most of my shopping by phone. You know Roz, this conversation with Doug has got me thinking about my father. He doesn't do much of anything either. He just sits around most of the time watching TV and doing the occasional crossword puzzle. What does your mother do? 
- - Yeah, quote mom, "Crime never stops - even in the dairy state!"
  - <i>laughs</i> I don't think public office is for Dad, but maybe I could find him a hobby or something. Any suggestions? 
- - She's the attorney general of Wisconsin.
  - <i>not believing</i> No, really! 
- - Well, in her spare time my mom likes to water ski a little. She hikes, oil paints... oh, she likes archaeology. She's on a dig in Honduras right now.
  - <i>making up for it</i> Well, maybe I could get him a wood burning set.<i>FADE OUT</i>
- - Yes, he's napping with the dog. Eddie's little legs are going like mad. I think he's dreaming about chasing rabbits. <i>thinks<i> I can't explain your father's twitching!

- - Really!
  - I guess that helps fill her day. 
- - Hi, guys.
  - Dad. 
- - <i>mock anger<i> Dr. Crane, you naughty boy. Peeking in on other people's privacy.
  - Daphne, really. I mean, if people were so concerned about their precious privacy they wouldn't leave their blinds open at that certain angle where you can see the mirror over the mantle that reflects down the hall to the water bed in the back room! 
- - I think your dad's going to love it. 
  - Me, too. I was walking through the hobby shop and saw this thing and it was like, "Eureka!" I actually said "Eureka!" <i>looking through scope</i> Ah, yes. There are a million stories in the naked city. <i>hopeful</i> Now if we could just find a naked one. 
- - <i>to Eddie<i> Hey, where did you just come from?
  - Dad, I got a surprise for you. <i>Daphne and Martin step away revealing the scope.</i> 
- - Hey, it's a beaut. What's the occasion?
  - Oh, no occasion, just thought you'd like it. 
- - Wow, that's great, thanks. You know, I saw in the news there's a bunch of falcons nesting in the eaves of the Columbia Tower. Maybe I can watch them from here.
  - Dad, Dad, forget the falcons. You can see everything that's going on in that apartment building over there. 
- - <i>objecting<i> Hey, I've locked people up for that kind of behavior.
  - Oh come on, it's perfectly innocent - just think of it as a hundred more channels to watch. 
- - <i>laughs<i> Well, there's a lady over there with a telescope. She's looking right back at us.
  - <i>nervous</i> What shall we do? 
- - <i>looking<i> No, that's tomato juice - you can see the can on the counter. You're right about that woman at the computer though, she's a looker.
  - Ah, you see, there's a voyeur in all of us. 
- - <i>worried<i> Hide!<i>Frasier goes for cover behind the fireplace as Daphne ducks behind the centre pole.<i>
  - I knew it, I knew it, every time we do something bad we get caught! 
- - She's waving at us, I'm waving back.
  - Don't do that! 
- - <i>waves and shouts<i> Hi, how you doing?
  - What are you doing? 
- - Why not? Hey wait, she's writing something down. She's holding it up. It says, "Hello there, stranger." <i>laughs<i> Hey Daphne, get me that pad and pen.
  - What for? 
- - So I can answer her. Write down "My name is Martin." 
  - Dad, Dad you shouldn't encourage this person. I don't really want people looking in on our lives. I don't think I've even made my bed today. 
- - Her name's Irene.
  - <i>sarcastic</i> Thank you. 
- - Oh right, he's the one with the wife that won't let him visit. I can't stand her.
  - <i>enters from room in gown</i> Morning Dad, Daphne. <i>waves to window</i> Morning, Irene. 
- - Hey Frasier, when you were a kid, what was the name of that skin condition you had on your butt?
  - Pityriasis Rosea. 
- - How do you spell that?
  - <i>curious</i> Why? 
- - Irene and I are exchanging family histories. 
  - I really don't think your girlfriend needs to know about that. 
- - <i>objecting<i> She's not my girlfriend!
  - Oh, come on. You two have been exchanging notes now for the past three days. If you were in the sixth grade you would be sitting in a tree "K-I-S-S-I-N-G." Here Daphne, let me borrow that pen. <i>he does</i> 
- - What are you doing?
  - I'm going to help along your little romance and possibly save a small forest. I'm giving her our telephone number. 
- - <i>in terror<i> No, no, no, no, no, don't do that!
  - Why? 
- - Well, she'll think I'm being too forward.
  - For God's sake, Dad, you met peeping into her apartment. 
- - <i>sure<i> She's not going to call.
  - You want to bet? 
- - Yeah, five bucks.
  - <i>holds card up</i> Okay.<i>There is less than a second of silence before the phone begins to ring and Frasier smirks at his father smugly.</i>
- - You get it.
  - Dad, it's for you!<i>Martin, however, will not answer so Frasier does the honors.</i>
- - <i>whispers<i> Tell her I'm not home.
  - Dad, she knows you're home - she's looking at you through the telescope. 
- - I'm getting a very good feeling about this.
  - Really? You really think he's interested in her? 
- - Do you want to hear something cute, Dr. Crane? I made him this rich gooey coffee cake this morning, because you know what a sweet tooth he has. And he wouldn't take one bite because - as he put it - "Women don't like a spare tire on a man."
  - <i>laughs</i> That's so cute. Oh, it's funny, you know - the twists and turns of fate. If I had tried to set Dad up with a woman he would have rejected the idea out of hand - but I go out get him this telescope for a hobby and it kindles this romance. It's Kismet!<i>As Daphne begins cutting the cake, Martin enters the kitchen and begins looking in the fridge without saying a word. Frasier and Daphne just stare at him until</i>
- - She said a lot of stuff.
  - <i>certain</i> So it would be safe to assume that you two will be seeing each other? 
- - There he was, proclaiming the Petrus to be the superior wine and of course none of us could contain our laughter.
  - His face must have turned redder than a "Piechon&eacute; Logeavie." 
- - Well of course, as so often happens, rough house turns to tears. At the end of the evening, Brewster tended his resignation.
  - That must have put a damper on the evening. 
- - Ah, she wanted to, but I said no.
  - <i>confused</i> No? Why? 
- - You know Brewster Cale? The pompous twit who is the president of our wine club? <i>Frasier nods.<i> Well, at our meeting the other night I convinced some of my fellow psychiatrists to play a little prank on him. When he thought he was tasting the Chateau Petrus, he was in fact sipping a Forcas Dupres. You see, we'd switched the labels. <i>laughs at the farce<i>
  - <i>sarcastic</i> What scamps you are! 
- - Well, not really. I'm the new president.
  - Kudos indeed. 
- - Oh, oh, oh, is our dad and his lady friend still playing telescope footsy? What was her name?
  - Irene. No, they've broken it off. 
- - Already? I thought it was going so well.
  - Well it was, but then they spoke once and Dad said that she wasn't his type. <i>objecting</i> So, it's over - done! He's completely cut her out of his life. I just don't understand what would make him do that. 
- - Oh, who knows why anybody does anything?
  - Remind me again what you do for a living? You see the thing is, it was just one phone call. How can anyone make a sound judgment about another person on the basis of one phone call? 
- - Remind me again what it is YOU do for a living?
  - Well anyway, I suppose it could be any number of reasons. Fear of rejection, shyness... 
- - <i>obviously leading up to something<i> Or maybe Dad was telling the truth and he just wasn't her type. If only we knew someone who was... I know! Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice is in town visiting from Washington, D.C. Oh, oh, oh, maybe we should set Dad up with her.
  - <i>objecting</i> No, Niles, I've met Aunt Patrice. The woman is a loon. 
- - Frasier, do this for me. Every time Aunt Patrice comes to visit, Maris makes all these plans, before she dives under the duvet with a two-week migraine and I'm left holding the bag&mdash; literally and figuratively.
  - Oh, I don't think so, Niles. I know Dad, don't meddle. 
- - Alright, the least you could do is say hello to Aunt Patrice.
  - I'm not driving out to your house. 
- - You don't have to. She's sitting out in the car.
  - You left her in the car?! 
- - How's Freddie?
  - Oh, Frederick is fine. Oh, he sends his love. He said to thank you for the toy gun you gave him. At least what he can remember of it before Lilith smashed it to bits with a croquet mallet. 
- - <i>enters and looks through telescope<i> Oh it's such a beautiful night. The city is lit up like a jewel. Oh look, there's Irene. She's sitting in her window wearing a stunning green dress. But her face, it's so sad. 
  - <i>looks</i> Oh, oh, she's holding a note. It says, "Martin, was it something I wrote?" 
- - Will you cut it out? Irene is not sitting in her window.
  - Oh alright Dad, no she isn't, but she might as well be, for god's sakes. That's gotta be what she's thinking! 
- - Haven't you ever met a woman and then decide she's not the one? <i>doorbell sounds<i>
  - Yes, five years after I married her. <i>Frasier opens the door to Niles and Maris's Aunt Patrice.</i> 
- - Hello there, Frasier.
  - Niles - I was specifically not expecting you. 
- - Frasier, you remember Aunt Patrice.
  - <i>greets her</i> Well, of course. Aunt Patrice, yes. I don't recall really when we met but I believe there was a lot of laughing and dancing.
- - My husband's funeral.
  - Yes... well, of course, the laughter was to hide our tears. Let me take your wrap. <i>he does</i>
- - A capital idea, and why don't Frasier and I join you? That'll give these kids some time to get to know one another.<i>Reset to KitchenNiles, Frasier and Daphne enter the kitchen. Daphne knocks up some refreshments as Frasier gives Niles a stern lecture.<i>
  - Niles, I distinctly told you not to bring her here. 
- - I ran out of ways to entertain her. We went to the arboretum, a fashion show, a matin&eacute;e of "La Cage Aux Folles" and we even spat off the top of the Space Needle. I'm sorry, I cracked!
  - Niles, that woman is certainly not Dad's type. 
- - Neither do I, we are alike in so many ways!
  - Oh come on, Niles. We can't leave Dad out there alone with her any longer.<i>Reset to Living RoomThey re-enter the living room.</i> 
- - Oh, b'ge ag sp'gort, Gniles.
  - What did she say? 
- - B'ge, agus, gesport, geda!
  - Dad, do you still have your gun loaded? 
- - <i>enters from kitchen<i> I found some pizza rolls in the back of the freezer, but the expiration date was yesterday - are we game?
  - Er, that won't be necessary, Daphne. We don't want to spoil our appetites for that dinner we're about to leave for in twenty minutes. 
- - That's who I'm talking about.<i>She leaves to the kitchen.<i>
  - You know, I saw what you just did. 
- - What did who do?
  - When Patrice went to hug you, you moved away. 
- - <i>laughs<i> Well, wouldn't you?
  - No, Dad, no. You moved away from the window. You didn't want Irene to see you with another woman. You still care about her. 
- - Hey, go chase yourself.
  - Dad, you do. There's something stopping you from having a relationship with this woman. Now, what is it? 
- - Alright. Irene's middle name is Rose.
  - So? Rose is a nice name. Rose was mother's middle name. <i>realises</i> Oh. 
- - You're not going to let go of this thing, are you?
  - No, I'm not! 
- - Yeah.
  - Oh Dad, you can't feel guilty about that. Gee, mom's been gone for six years now. Your feelings for Irene are totally severed from your feelings for Mom. You know, if she was here, if she could tell you, she'd want you to get on with your life. 
- - Okay, when I'm ready. Thanks, Frasier. You know - I guess I don't say it often enough but you're a good kid.
  - Well, thanks Dad. You know, there's something I don't say often enough... 
- - <i>correcting<i> There's nothing you don't say often enough.
  - <i>realizes what he means</i> Right, Dad.<i>Reset to KitchenMartin enters the kitchen to find Daphne busying herself in the fridge.</i> 
- - Yeah, me too. Thanks for our little talk.
  - My pleasure.<i>Martin looks at Daphne as if to say thank you. She nods a reply.</i>
- - Well, it's a long time since I've been dating. Have things changed much in the last forty years?
  - Well, the wardrobe's a little different - but your ultimate goal is still the same! Dad, I'm glad you changed your mind about this. 
- - Yep.
  - Terrific, alright. Have you got your keys? 
- - Yeah.
  - You're not going to be out too late, are you? 
- - Frasier! 
  - Dad, I'm just busting your chops here.<i>The doorbell goes and both Frasier and Martin go "Oh My God." To understand this scene you've got to realize that Daphne and Frasier seem to act like the mother and father and Martin seems to be their kid going on a first date.</i>
